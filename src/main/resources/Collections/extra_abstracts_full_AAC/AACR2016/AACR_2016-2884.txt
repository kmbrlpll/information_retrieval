Title: Role of Kaiso in intestinal tumorigenesis


p120-catenin is a master regulator of classical cadherin stability and
essential for epithelial homeostasis. p120 physically interacts with
transcription factor Kaiso (ZBTB33) suggesting a direct or indirect role
in transcription, but its precise function with respect to Kaiso is
largely unknown. Kaiso belongs to the ZBTB family of transcription
factors, most of which have important roles in development and/or cancer.
Interestingly, Kaiso is strongly expressed in the intestinal crypt and
abruptly downregulated as the cells move up onto the villus and
terminally differentiate. Kaiso is constitutively upregulated in nascent
adenomas initiated by loss of the tumor suppressor APC, suggesting a link
between canonical Wnt signaling, Kaiso upregulation and intestinal
tumorigenesis. Here, using ChipSeq and proteomics we describe several
candidate Kaiso interactions with a group of proteins that include the
tumor suppressor BRCA1, CHD2 (a chromatin remodifier) and the Ets1
oncoprotein, along with preliminary evidence for functional significance
relevant to intestinal tumorigenesis.
