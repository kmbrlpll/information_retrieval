Title: Weight change, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and biochemical
recurrence in a prospective cohort study of U.S. men


Obesity is associated with an increased risk of fatal prostate cancer.
However, the relevant timing of obesity for risk has not been
established, and the impact of weight change on prognosis has been
understudied.We prospectively investigated the association between weight
change and obesity with prostate cancer outcomes among 5,173 men
diagnosed with prostate cancer (clinical TNM-stage 30 lbs had a 1.44-fold
higher risk of lethal cancer (95% CI 1.03-2.01, p-trend = 0.06, adjusting
for lifestyle factors, stage, grade, PSA at diagnosis, and weight at age
21). Among never smokers, this association was stronger (HR 2.19, 95% CI
1.31-3.68, p-trend = 0.005). Weight gain in the 4 years preceding
diagnosis was suggestively, but not significantly, associated with lethal
cancer among never smokers (HR for >5 lbs gain vs stable weight [5 lbs]
1.48, 95% CI, 0.96, 2.28). No significant associations were found between
weight change and biochemical recurrence.Our findings suggest a positive
association between adult weight gain and risk of lethal prostate cancer.
Metabolic changes associated with weight gain may promote prostate cancer
progression.
