Title: Evolution of resistance to EGFR inhibition from drug tolerant
cancer cells


Acquired drug resistance to targeted cancer therapies remains a
significant clinical problem. Although mechanisms of acquired resistance
of EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancers to EGFR inhibitors have been
identified, little is known about how resistant clones evolve during drug
therapy. We demonstrate that acquired resistance caused by the T790M
gatekeeper mutation can occur either by selection of pre-existing T790M
clones or via evolution of T790M-negative drug tolerant cells that
develop the mutation during drug treatment. Additionally, the path to
resistance impacts the biology of the resistant clone, as those that
evolved from drug tolerant cells have a diminished apoptotic response to
third generation EGFR inhibitors that target T790M EGFR. To characterize
drug tolerant cells in patients undergoing EGFR inhibitor therapy, we
performed single-cell RNA-Seq on EGFR mutant NSCLC samples prior to and
after initiation of EGFR inhibitor. These results offer novel insights
into the evolution of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and point to
new therapeutic opportunities to prevent or overcome resistance in the
clinic.
