Title: Nuclear receptor, ESRRG functions as tumor suppressor by
preventing Helicobacter pylori infection in gastric cancer


Gastric cancer (GC) is the most common cancer type in Asia. Surgical
resection and chemotherapy is standard treatment of GC. Molecular
therapeutic targets and mechanism contributing to develop the gastric
cancer is poorly understood. To discover the molecular target in gastric
cancer, we analyzed gene expression data from gastric cancer patients.
Data analysis reveals that nuclear receptor ESRRG is top candidate gene
conferring the tumor suppressive property in gastric cancer. ESRRG
expression is down-modulated by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)
infection, which is one of causing factor triggering gastric cancer. In
addition, ectopically over-expressed ESRRG protects the cell from H.
pylori infection and suppressed cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo
mouse model. Gene expression profile reveals that TFF1, which is well
known as tumor suppressor in gastric cancer is down-stream target of
ESRRG and ESRRG well reflects clinical outcome in gastric cancer. Our
study provides new molecular insights how ESRRG regulates gastric cancer
cell growth induced by H. pylori and suggests possibility that ESSRRG can
be therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer patients.
