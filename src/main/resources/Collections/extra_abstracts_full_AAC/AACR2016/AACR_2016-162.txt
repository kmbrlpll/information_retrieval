Title: Genomic analysis of uterine aspirates improves diagnosis and
captures the intratumor heterogeneity in endometrial cancer


Background: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common cancer in female
genital tract in developed countries. Although the majority of ECs are
diagnosed in early stages, with a 5-year overall survival of around 80%,
an early detection of these tumors is crucial to increase survival of
patients given that advanced tumors are associated with poorer outcome.
Furthermore, the correct assessment of pre-clinical diagnosis is also
decisive to guide the surgical management and treatment of the
patient.Results: Genetic analysis of uterine aspirates identifies the
mutational profile of endometrial cancers and represents the intra-tumor
heterogeneity found in the analysis of multiple tumor regions from
hysterectomy.Conclusions: The current study reveals the potential of the
genetic analysis of uterine aspirates as a pre-operative tool to
diagnosis, even in biopsies with insufficient material, with a
sensitivity of 93.7% and a specificity of 91.7%. Additionally, genetic
analysis of uterine aspirates allows to capture the intra-tumor
heterogeneity identified in ECs.
