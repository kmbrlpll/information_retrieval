Title: TEM8/ANTXR1 specific T cells co-target tumor stem cells and tumor
vasculature in triple-negative breast cancer


Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast
cancer with no approved targeted therapies. Tumor endothelial marker 8
(TEM8), initially identified as a marker of tumor endothelial cells in
colorectal cancer and other solid tumors has recently been shown to be
upregulated in TNBC and breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). We investigated
whether TEM8 specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells recognize
and kill both tumor endothelial cells as well as TNBC tumor cells. TEM8
specific CAR molecules were generated using single chain variable
fragment derived from the monoclonal antibody, L2. L2 CAR T cells
selectively recognized TEM8, secreted immunostimulatory cytokines and
effectively killed both TEM8 positive TNBC and tumor endothelial cell
lines. Moreover, L2 CAR T cells targeted breast cancer stem cells
significantly reducing the number of mammospheres relative to
non-transduced T cells. In vivo, adoptive transfer of L2 CAR T cells
induced regression of established vascularized TNBC xenografts. Hence,
TEM8 may serve as an attractive target for immunotherapy of TNBC.
