Title: IL-4 derived from T follicular helper cells in tumor draining
lymph nodes regulate myeloid cell properties and anti-tumor immunity


Recent findings show that immune cells constitute a large fraction of the
tumor microenvironment and modulate tumor progression. Clinical data
indicate that chronic inflammation is present at tumor sites and that
IL-4 in particular is up-regulated. Current results demonstrate that T
follicular helper (Tfh) cells arise in tumor draining lymph nodes where
they produce an abundance of IL-4. Deletion of IL-4 expressing Tfh cells
improves anti-tumor immunity, delays tumor growth and reduces the
immunosuppressive activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and
M2 macrophages. These findings suggest that IL-4 from Tfh cells impact
anti-tumor immunity and constitute an attractive therapeutic target to
reduce immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment and thus enhance
the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.
