Title: OncoGxOneTM - an advanced genomic test for precision cancer
treatment


The fundamental cause of cancer is the aberration of genes that control
cell proliferation and apoptosis. With the rapid advancement of genomic
technologies and increased arsenal of targeted therapies, genomic
profiling has been largely accepted by physicians to assist cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Developed by Admera Health, OncoGxOneTM is a
CLIA certified and CAP accredited genomic profiling panel detecting all
actionable mutations in 64 cancer genes. All the FDA approved targeted
therapies and registered clinical trials are covered by this carefully
designed panel. Utilizing cutting edge Next Generation Sequencing
technology combined with accurate analysis and data interpretation,
OncoGxOneTM detects all 4 types of genomic alterations including single
nucleotide mutation, insertion/deletion, copy number variation and gene
rearrangement. Using fresh frozen tissue or routine FFPE samples,
OncoGxOne TM offers both high sensitivity and specificity greater than
99% from samples with as low as 10% tumor cell content.
