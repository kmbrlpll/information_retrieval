Title: The yeast homolog of the mammalian oncogene, Bax Inhibitor-1,
regulates the unfolded protein response by altering the ER
microenvironment


Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an anti-apoptotic gene whose expression is
upregulated in a wide range of human cancers. The yeast homolog of BI-1,
yeast Bax inhibitor-1 (BXI1), encodes a protein that belongs to the Bax
Inhibitor (TMBIM) family of proteins. The crystal structure of a
prokaryotic member of the family, BsYetJ, has revealed that the Bax
inhibitor proteins are pH sensitive calcium leaks. Our studies have shown
that yeast Bxi1p is localized to the ER and is involved in the unfolded
protein response (UPR) that is triggered by ER stress. We have recently
found that Bxi1p regulates the UPR downstream of endonuclease Ire1p
clustering but upstream of HAC1 mRNA splicing. Studies with an ER
localized calcium reporter and an ER redox reporter suggest that Bxi1p
accomplishes this by altering the ER microenvironment. [Our laboratory is
