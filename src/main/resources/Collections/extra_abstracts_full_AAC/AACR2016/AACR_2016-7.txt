Title: LKB1 deficiency is associated with a unique metabolic signature in
Kras mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)


LKB1 deficiency is found in approximately 10% of non-small cell lung
cancer harboring Kras mutation. Loss of LKB1 has been associated with
increased metastatic rates and decreased survival in patients. Currently,
no effective therapy has been developed against this subtype of lung
cancer. LKB1 can regulate multiple cellular activities. One of the most
well-studied functions is its regulation on cell metabolism through AMPK
signaling pathway. How LKB1 loss globally impacts NSCLC metabolism has
not been well understood yet. Using isotope-labeled substrate tracing
approach, we found an increase of specially-labeled intermediates in
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that may suggest upregulation of PPP
activity. In addition, we also performed an unbiased drug screen that
showed higher sensitivity to an mTOR inhibitor in Kras and LKB1 double
mutant lung cancer cells relative to cancer cells under other genetic
background. These data suggest that loss of LKB1 may upregulate
biosynthetic reactions in Kras mutant NSCLC and render these cells
sensitive to inhibitors in biosynthesis. These findings may provide new
insights in developing therapeutic agents targeting KrasMT/LKB1MT NSCLC.
