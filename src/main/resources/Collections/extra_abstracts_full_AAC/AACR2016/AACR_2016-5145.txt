Title: To explore the tumorigenic regulation mechanism of SPZ1 in
hepatocellular carcinoma


Cancer directly affects at least one-third of the human population.
Despite this extensively, the genetic determinants of cancer risk remain
unknown. Spermatogenic leucine zipper 1 (SPZ1), a basic helix loop helix
leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) transcription factor, acted as a proto-oncogene
in mouse and human. It has been demonstrated that SPZ1 was involved in
early embryonic development, cell growth and differentiation. In this
study, we compared the expression of SPZ1 in 168 paired specimens of HCCs
and adjacent normal tissues and also in paired specimens from 140
patients with non-HCCs. In pathologic analysis, SPZ1 exhibited a
tumor-specific expression pattern and a high correlation to patient
survival time, tumor size, tumor number, and progression stage. Enforced
expression of SPZ1 accelerated cell proliferation and tumorigenic
activity in hepatoma cells. In contrast, short hairpin RNA-mediated
attenuation of SPZ1 in hepatoma cells decreased cell proliferation and
malignant transformation in vitro and in vivo. Together, we speculated
that SPZ1 as a potential therapeutic target of HCCs
