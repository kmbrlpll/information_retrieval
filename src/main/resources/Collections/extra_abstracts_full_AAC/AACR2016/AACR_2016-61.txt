Title: A genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening method for protein stability
reveals novel regulators of Cdc25A


The regulation of stability is particularly crucial for unstable proteins
in cells. However, a convenient and unbiased method of identifying
regulators of protein stability remains to be generated. Recently,
genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 library has been established as a genetic tool
to mediate loss of function screening. Here, we developed a method named
Protein Stability Regulators Screening Assay (Pro-SRSA) by combining the
whole genome CRISPR-Cas9 library with a dual-fluorescence-based protein
stability reporter and high-throughput sequencing to screen regulators of
protein stability. Using Cdc25A as an example, Cul4B-DDB1-DCAF8 was
determined to be a new E3 ligase for Cdc25A. Moreover, the acetylation of
Cdc25A at lysine 150, which was mediated by p300/CBP and deacetylated by
HDAC3, was revealed to prevent its ubiquitin-mediated degradation by
proteasome. This is the first report that the acetylation as a novel
posttranslational modification modulates the Cdc25A stability, and we
believe that this efficient and unbiased screening method at the
genome-scale will be widely used to globally identify regulators of
protein stability.
