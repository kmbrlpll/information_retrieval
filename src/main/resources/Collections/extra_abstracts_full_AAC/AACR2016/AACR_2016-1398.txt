Title: RNA DIRECT: A novel strategy for targeted RNA enrichment of
transcripts associated with solid tumors


RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a powerful platform for profiling
transcriptomes that enables gene expression analysis and identification
of nucleotide or structural variations. RNA-seq, however, can be cost
prohibitive due to the size and complexity of most transcriptomes, which
require deep sequencing coverage to achieve the necessary sensitivity for
a reliable analysis. By combining targeted enrichment strategies with
next-generation sequencing (NGS), a subset of transcript regions or
sequences can be enriched for and analyzed with the resolution required
for both research and clinical applications.The RNA DIRECT targeted
enrichment method utilizes probe-based hybridization to capture only
relevant cDNA sequences. Targeted sequences are then ligated to NGS
platform specific adaptors and amplified by PCR. The RNA DIRECT strategy
provides a robust and cost effective method for the enrichment of
transcript sequences for the purpose of identification and detection of
known or novel variants and gene fusions. To demonstrate the high
specificity, sensitivity and uniformity of this method, we have applied
it to the capture of targets commonly associated with solid tumors.
