Title: Inhibition of glycolysis sensitizes cancer cells to
metformin-induced anoikis


Metformin is a widely used medicine to treat type 2 diabetes. Clinical
studies have shown that metformin can reduce cancer incidence, yet the
molecular mechanism of which is not totally understood. The p53-related
p63 plays a critical role in regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis,
differentiation and development. We and others have shown that the major
isform of p63 proteins, Np63, is important in regulation of squamous
carcinoma cell proliferation, survival and cancer metastasis (Bergholz et
al.,Oncogene 33:212-224, 2014;Li et al.,CDDis,2013, e943; doi:10.10384).
In this study, we show that metformin can induce instability of Np63
protein, leading to subsequent anoikis. In addition, glucose restriction
or inhibition of glycolysis significantly sensitizes cells to metformin.
Furthermore, we show that integrin 1 is involved in this process. Taken
together, this study reveals a novel molecular mechanism by which
metformin inhibits squamous carcinoma formation in vitro and in vivo.
