Title: Organoids and patient-derived tumor xenograft of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma share morphological and genetic features with the primary
tumor


Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of
cancer death, with a 5-year overall survival rate 90% and 70% of PDACs
respectively, and a few rare somatic mutations, such as a sodium leak
channel (NALCN) mutation, seen in 3% of PDAC.Both PDX and organoid models
of PDAC maintain key histological features, immunohistochemical profile
and basic gene expression pattern akin to the primary tumor. These
findings suggest that PDXs and organoids have the potential to serve as
reliable pathophysiological models for optimizing individual therapy for
patients with PDAC.
