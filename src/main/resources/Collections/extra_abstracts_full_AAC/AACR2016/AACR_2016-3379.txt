Title: Tumor-induced remote extracellular matrix network orientation
steers angiogenesis


Tumor angiogenesis promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Here, we use
automated sequential microprinting of tumor and endothelial cells in
extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds to study its mechanical aspects.
Quantitative reflection microscopy shows that tumor spheroids induce
radial orientation of the surrounding collagen fiber network up to a
distance of five times their radius. Across a panel of 20 different human
tumor cell lines, remote collagen orientation is correlated with local
tumor cell migration behavior. Tumor induced collagen orientation
requires contractility but is remarkably resistant to depletion of
collagen-binding integrins. Microvascular endothelial cells undergo
directional migration towards tumor spheroids once they are within the
tumor-oriented collagen fiber network. Laser ablation experiments
indicate that an intact physical connection of the oriented network with
the tumor spheroid is required for mechanical sensing by the endothelial
cells. Together our findings show that remote physical manipulation of
the ECM network by the tumor steers angiogenesis.
