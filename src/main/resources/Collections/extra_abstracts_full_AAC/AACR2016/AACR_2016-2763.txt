Title: DNA methylation profiling unveils TGF- hyperresponse in tumor
associated fibroblasts from lung cancer patients


There is growing interest in defining the aberrant molecular differences
between normal and tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) that support tumor
progression. For this purpose, we recently conducted a genome-wide DNA
methylation profiling of TAFs and paired control fibroblasts (CFs) from
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and reported a widespread
hypomethylation concomitantly with focal gain of DNA methylation; in
addition, we found evidence that a fraction of lung TAFs are fibrocytes
in origin. Of note, the aberrant epigenome of lung TAFs had a global
impact in gene expression and a selective impact on the TGF- pathway. To
get insights on the functional implications of the latter impact, we
analyzed the response of lung TAFs to exogenous TGF-1 in terms of
activation and contractility. We found a larger expression of a panel of
activation markers including -SMA and collagen-I in TAFs compared to
control fibroblasts. Likewise, TGF-1 elicited a larger contractility in
TAFs than in CFs as assessed by traction force microscopy. These findings
reveal that lung TAFs are hyperresponsive to TGF-1, which may underlie
the expansion and/or maintenance of the tumor-promoting desmoplastic
stroma in lung cancer.
