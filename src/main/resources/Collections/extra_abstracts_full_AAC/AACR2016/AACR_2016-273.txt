Title: Inhibition of EGFR/STAT3/CEBPD axis reverses cisplatin
cross-resistance with paclitaxel in urothelial carcinoma of urinary
bladder


Cisplatin (CDDP) is frequently used in combination chemotherapy with
paclitaxel (PTX) in the treatment of urothelial carcinomas of the urinary
bladder (UCUB). The development of CDDP cross-resistance with PTX has
been suggested and remains a challenge that hinders successful UCUB
treatment. Consequently, elucidating the mechanisms underlying
CDDP-induced anticancer drug resistance is imperative, and this knowledge
will aid in the development of novel strategies. CEBPD expression was
maintained in post-operative chemotherapy patients, and this expression
was responsive to CDDP even in CDDP-resistant UCUB cells. Upon CDDP
treatment, CEBPD activated ABCB1 and ABCC2. The EGFR/STAT3 pathway
contributed to CDDP-induced CEBPD expression in UCUB cells. Treatment
with gefitinib and S3I-201 significantly decreased CEBPD expression and
enhanced sensitivity of CDDP-resistant NTUB1/P cells to CDDP and PTX. Our
results demonstrate the risk of CEBPD activation in CDDP-resistant UCUB
cells and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients
with UCUB and UCUB with CDDP-induced PTX resistance using CDDP in
combination with either gefitinib or S3I-201.
