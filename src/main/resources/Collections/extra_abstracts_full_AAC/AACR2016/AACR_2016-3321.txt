Title: PUMA expression targets v3/Slug+ stem-like tumor cells to prevent
breast cancer progression independent of subtype


Breast cancer cells bearing similarities to normal mammary stem cells
represent some of the most aggressive tumors cells. Here, we show that
v3/Slug+ stem-like tumor cells are highly vulnerable to cell death
induced by PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis). In human breast
cancers, we were surprised to find that v3/Slug+ cells represent a unique
subset of tumor cells associated with progression that are present in all
major histological subtypes. Analysis of stem-like cell lines showed that
v3 directs an EMT-independent role for Slug in suppressing PUMA
expression and promoting tumor cell survival and stemness. In fact, v3 is
both necessary and sufficient for PUMA suppression and PUMA knockdown
specifically rescued defective colony formation and tumor initiation
caused by decreased 3 expression. Inducing PUMA expression with specific
therapies selectively ablated v3/Slug+ cells, preventing the formation of
new colonies or tumors, with no effect on established disease. These new
findings define an unexpected role for v3/Slug-mediated PUMA suppression
in driving stemness and suggest that inducing PUMA with specific
therapies can selectively target stem-like breast cancer cells to prevent
aggressive disease.
