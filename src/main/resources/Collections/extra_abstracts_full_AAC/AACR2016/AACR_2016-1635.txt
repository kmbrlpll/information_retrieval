Title: The histone demethylase KDM3A in Ewing Sarcoma metastasis


This study aims to explore the roles and mechanisms of new candidates for
therapeutic targeting in Ewing Sarcoma. Ewing Sarcoma is an aggressive
pediatric malignancy of the bone and soft tissue, driven by EWS/Ets
oncogenic fusions and characterized by high propensity for metastasis and
poor clinical outcomes. We have identified the histone demethylase KDM3A
as a novel tumor and metastasis promoter downstream of EWS/Fli1, the most
common driver in this disease. Moreover, we have identified the cell
surface protein, Melanoma Cell Adhesion Molecule (MCAM), as a potential
important mediator of KDM3A action. Our data show that both KDM3A and
MCAM depletion can inhibit growth and metastatic phenotypes. Additionally
we explore the regulation of MCAM, showing that KDM3A may upregulate MCAM
expression both through a direct as well as an indirect mechanism via the
Ets1 transcription factor. Since both KDM3A and MCAM are
pharmacologically targetable, understanding of this pathway could provide
at least two new therapeutic targets in Ewing Sarcoma, and, importantly
alternatives to drugging of EWS/Ets fusions, which to date has proven
very difficult.
