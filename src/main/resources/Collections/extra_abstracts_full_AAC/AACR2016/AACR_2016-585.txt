Title: Assessing ENPP3 as a renal cancer target for bispecific T-cell
engager (BiTE) therapy


BiTE therapeutics are single chain antibody constructs harboring two
binding moieties: one directed at a tumor associated antigen and one
directed at the CD3e protein, which trigger T cell dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (TDCC) against targeted cancer cells. Here, we evaluated the
suitability of ENPP3 as a potential BiTE target. The ENPP3 mRNA is highly
differentially expressed in clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) and
the ENPP3 protein is detected with high uniformity and intensity in ccRCC
tumor samples by immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated the surface
expression of this protein in Renal Cancer cell lines and confirmed that
the ENPP3 protein was highly restricted to the luminal side of normal
epithelial layers in which it was detected (proximal renal tubules,
bronchial epithelium, salivary glands). We developed highly potent
anti-ENPP3 BiTE molecules and demonstrated the in vitro TDCC activity of
these molecules. Two anti-ENPP3 BiTE molecules further demonstrated tumor
formation inhibition activity in a human T cell / human target cell
admixture mouse xenograft model.
