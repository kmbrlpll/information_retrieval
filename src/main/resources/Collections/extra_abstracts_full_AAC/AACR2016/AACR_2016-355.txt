Title: HT flow cytometry platform enabling measurement of immune
signaling in whole blood and T-cells for drug discovery


Oral agents targeting Janus-associated kinases (JAKs) are among the most
promising new agents in clinical development. To better understand the
relationship between JAK inhibition and clinical outcome, compounds
targeting JAKs are required to be analyzed in peripheral whole blood. To
date, this type of analysis has been low throughput and is associated
with high cost. Here, we developed a robust 384-well flow based assay
approach to screen small molecules for inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling
in whole blood using high-throughput flow cytometry. The platform
provides a highly sensitive analysis of signaling events in low volumes
of blood facilitating a robust target engagement assay to measure
inhibition of proximal signaling by selective JAK inhibitors. Further,
automation technologies and processes optimization were established to
overcome bottlenecks in sample integrity, handling and multiparametric
data analysis without affecting assay performance. The result was
dramatically increased sample throughput when compared to conventional
manual flow cytometric approaches enabling the identification of novel
selective JAK/STAT inhibitors enabling the investigation of IO and
Immunology targets earlier in drug discovery.
