Title: PKR and Jagged1 associated with lymph node metastasis in lung
cancer


In the current study, we analyzed the association between lymph node
metastasis and over 50 biomarkers in 319 NSCLC patients. We observed that
tumor location and the protein expressions of Jagged1 and RNA-dependent
protein kinase (PKR) have significantly association with the lymph node
metastasis. We further investigated the mechanism of interaction between
Jagged1 and PKR, and demonstrated that induction of PKR promotes Jagged1
protein degradation through proteasome system in lung cancer cells. We
also found that combination of Jagged1 with PKR improved prognostic value
in all stages NSCLC patients. However, combination of Jagged1 with PKR
did not improve lymph node metastatic value. Taken together, our data
suggest that PKR and Jagged1 are independent markers for predicting lymph
node metastasis, and PKR may reduce lymph node metastasis partly by
promote Jagged1 proteins degradation in NSCLC patients.
