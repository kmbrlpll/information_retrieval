Title: Systematic validation of microRNA based prognostic biomarkers for
stage II, III and IV colorectal cancer


microRNA (miRNA) based biomarkers have great potential due to their
critical regulatory functions, superior stability, and relative small
number compared to mRNAs. We have previously discovered a number of
miRNAs that play key roles in colon cancer stem cell resistance and
demonstrated their clinical potential as prognostic biomarkers. In this
study, we have validated the prognostic potential of a panel of miRNAs in
204 stage II, III, and IV colorectal cancer specimens by qRT-PCR
analysis. Many of the miRNAs have been functionally validated to be
important in contributing to chemoresistance to 5-FU based chemotherapy.
We also determined that miR-16 is the most consistent miRNA for
expression normalization. We have validated several miRNAs that are
significantly associated with disease free survival (DFS) and overall
survival (OS) of stage II, III and IV colorectal cancer patients. This
study, together with some of the previous studies, establishes a solid
foundation for miRNA based precision management of colorectal cancer.
