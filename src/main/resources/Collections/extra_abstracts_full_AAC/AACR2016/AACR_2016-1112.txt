Title: miR-550a-x fuctions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the
oncogenic YAP1 in human cancers


Although Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), an essential downstream
effector of hippo pathway, is a potent oncogene and amplified in human
cancers, the overexpression mechanism is unclear. Herein, this study
shows that miR-550a-x directly inhibits the oncogenic YAP1 and functions
as a tumor suppressor in various human cancer cells. Ectopic
overexpression of miRNA-550a-x suppressed proliferation and survival of
various cancer cells via inducing apoptosis. miR-550a-x also had a
capacity to suppress cell migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition
and tumor sphere formation. Using bioinformatics and microarray analysis,
we found YAP1 as a putative target gene. miR-550a-x decreased the mRNA
and protein levels of YAP1 in various cancer cells and significantly
repressed YAP1 activity with its downstream target genes including CTGF
and CYR61. The expression level of miRNA-550a-x were inversely correlated
with the YAP1 expression in normal and colorectal cancer samples.
Therefore, our data suggest that miRNA-550X functions as a tumor
suppressor by targeting YAP1, which may provide a novel therapeutic
option for cancer treatment.
