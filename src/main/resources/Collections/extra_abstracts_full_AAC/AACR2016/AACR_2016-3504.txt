Title: Arginylated BiP/oxidized DJ-1 complex mediates crosstalk between
the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria


In cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL), although much is known about signal pathways involving
external signals through cell surface receptors or internal signals
through mitochondrial dysfunction, little is known about signal pathways
activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during TRAIL treatment.
Here, we report that TRAIL-induced caspase activation is a prerequisite
for TRAIL-induced ER stress response. During TRAIL treatment, ER chaperon
BiP dissociates from ER stress sensors such as PERK and IRE1 and the
activation of the PERK-eIF2-ATF4-CHOP apoptotic signal transduction
pathway occurs. Meanwhile ER-stress induces BiP release to the cytosol
and ATE1-encoded Arg-tRNA transferase arginylates BiP. TRAIL also induces
loss of m and redox sensor DJ-1 detects mitochondria-derived ROS.
Oxidized DJ-1 binds to arginylated BiP (R-BiP) in the cytosol. DJ-1
binding activity was abrogated in C106A and C53A but not C46A mutant.
R-BiP/oxidized DJ-1 complex may mediate crosstalk between the ER and
mitochondria.Key words: TRAIL; endoplasmic reticulum; apoptosis;
