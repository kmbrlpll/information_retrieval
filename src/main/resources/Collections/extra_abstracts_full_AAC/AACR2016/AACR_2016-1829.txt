Title: The validation of a pyrosequencing KRAS mutation detection assay


Mutations in the KRAS gene, especially affecting the codon 12 and 13
region of the Kras protein, have implications in the treatment of certain
cancer types. Because of the current potential for the FDA to oversee
laboratory developed procedures (LPDs), it is imminently important that
the validation of such tests be published to ensure that it is shown that
these LPDs are properly reviewed and properly tested within the CLIA
guidelines, thus keeping LPDs within the CLIA regulatory domain. We have
developed a pyrosequencing assay that can detect eleven mutations in the
codon 12 and 13 position of the KRAS gene. Our validation consisted of a
sensitivity study in which a purified mutant PCR product was introduced
into a wildtype DNA background and diluted down to undetectable levels.
This sensitivity test was done on six different KRAS codon 12/13 mutants
to determine the detection limit of the assay. Intra- and inter-assay
precision and assay accuracy was determined by comparing assay results of
over 40 total samples, both mutant and wild type, over five days carried
out by two technicians. The results will show that this KRAS
pyrosequencing assay falls within the acceptance criteria for
sensitivity, accuracy and precision.
