Title: LncRNA WDFY3-AS2 contributes to the EMT and metastasis in breast
cancer


The role of TGF in promoting mammary cell EMT and breast cancer
metastasis was well established. However, the involvement of long
non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in this process remains elusive. Here we
demonstrated that mouse lncRNA BB179049 and its human ortholog WDFY3-AS2
were significantly increased upon TGF-induced EMT. WDFY3-AS2 was
frequently elevated in invasive, metastatic and triple-negative breast
cancer. Depletion of WDFY3-AS2 abrogated TGF-induced EMT and breast
cancer metastasis. WDFY3-AS2 positively regulates STAT3 and WDFY3 through
interaction with hnRNP-R. These data indicate that WDFY3-AS2 could play a
pivotal role in TGF-induced EMT and metastasis and serves as a critical
therapeutic target in aggressive breast cancer.
