Title: EZH2 contributes to breast cancer metastasis


While the 5-year relative survival rate of localized stage breast cancer
is 99%, once the cancer spreads to distant lymph nodes and organs the
survival rate falls to 25%. In order to develop strategies to combat
metastasis, we have been studying epigenetic factors that contribute to
the aggressive nature of breast cancer. We have focused on enhancer of
zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyl transferase, because breast
cancer patients expressing increased EZH2 exhibit highest metastatic
recurrence. We have found through in vivo studies that blocking EZH2
activity not only prevents metastasis formation, but also targets
established metastases. Genome wide ChIP-seq analysis revealed that EZH2
may impact breast cancer metastasis through regulating the expression of
EMT marker, E-cadherin, and stem cell markers, GATA3 and DKK2.
Mammosphere assays from tumors treated with pharmacological blockade of
EZH2 and limiting dilution analysis validates that EZH2 inhibition
impacts the tumor-initiating cell population. Our data suggests that
inhibition of EZH2 activity may have anti-metastatic therapeutic
potential and may complement current standards of breast cancer therapy.
