Title: Analysis of human papillomavirus 16 variants and risk for cervical
cancer in Chinese population


HPV16 is the most carcinogenic HPV type, but only a minority of HPV16
infections progress to cancer. Intratype genetic variants of HPV16 have
been suggested to confer differential carcinogenicity. To investigate
risk implications of HPV16 variants among Chinese women, a case-control
study was conducted with 298 cervical cancer patients and 85 controls
(all HPV16-positive). HPV16 isolates were predominantly of the A variant
lineage, and variants of A4 (previously named Asian) sublineage were
common. A4/Asian variants were significantly associated with increased
risk of cervical cancer compared to A1-3 (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.04-2.85).
Furthermore, a meta-analysis including 703 cases and 323 controls from
East Asia confirmed the association (OR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.44-5.52). In
conclusion, A4 variants appear to predict higher risk of cervical cancer
among HPV16-positive women, which may provide clues to the genetic basis
of differences in the carcinogenicity of HPV16 variants.
