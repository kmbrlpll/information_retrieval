Title: Development of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models for
pancreatic carcinoma as a preclinical platform for drug development


Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) remains one of the most aggressive
tumors in humans. A notable feature of PDA is its innate resistance to
many chemotherapies. In preclinical studies, Abraxane showed antitumor
activity as a single agent and synergistic activity in combination with
gemcitabine in murine models of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we have
developed and characterized multiple models of patient derived xenograft
(PDX) pancreatic models. These models recapitulate major structural and
genetic features noted in patient populations. Developed PDX models are
from both prior treated and non prior treated patients with varying
levels of resistance to Gemcitibine. Here we have investigated efficacy
of standard of care agents in these pancreatic models and demonstrate the
potential utility of the pancreatic models in drug discovery efforts in
oncology for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
