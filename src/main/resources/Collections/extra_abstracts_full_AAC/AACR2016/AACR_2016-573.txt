Title: Preclinical evaluation of JTX-2011, an anti-ICOS agonist antibody


ICOS (inducible co-stimulator molecule) is a co-stimulatory molecule and
a member of the CD28 superfamily expressed primarily on T lymphocytes.
Analysis of cancer patient samples as well as rodent preclinical data
have implicated a role for the ICOS pathway in cancer immunotherapy. We
have generated a panel of anti-ICOS monoclonal antibodies with in vitro
agonistic properties. The anti-ICOS antibodies are efficacious as
monotherapies and in combination with anti-PD1 in multiple syngeneic
tumor models. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that tumor regression is
associated with enhanced ratios of cytotoxic CD8:T regulatory (Treg)
cells as well as preferential reduction in ICOS-high Tregs in the tumor
microenvironment. JTX-2011, a species cross-reactive high affinity
humanized agonist monoclonal antibody, has been selected for development.
Evaluation of JTX-2011 in nonhuman primate models will be presented,
including data informing safety and PK parameters. Our preclinical data
provides rational for clinical development of JTX-2011 as a cancer
immunotherapeutic to be tested as both a monotherapy as well as in
combination with immunotherapies in solid tumor indications.
