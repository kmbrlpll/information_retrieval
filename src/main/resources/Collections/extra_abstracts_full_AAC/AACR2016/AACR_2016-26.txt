Title: Sensitive step in cholesterol biosynthesis reveals role for sterol
metabolites in regulating growth of EGFR/KRAS-dependent tumors


We identified SC4MOL and NSDHL, two enzymes in the cholesterol pathway
and their substrates, meiosis activating sterols (MAS), as critical
regulators of receptor signaling and trafficking in normal development
and in cancer. Oncogenic transformation by EGFR or RAS increases the
demand for cholesterol, suggesting a possibility for metabolic
interference. To test this idea in vivo, we ablated Nsdhl in adult
keratinocytes expressing KRASG12D. Strikingly, Nsdhl inactivation
antagonized the growth of skin tumors, while having little effect on
normal skin. Loss of Nsdhl induced the expression of ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, reduced the expression of low-density
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), decreased intracellular cholesterol and was
dependent on the liver X receptor (LXR) . Importantly, EGFR signaling
opposed LXR effects on cholesterol homeostasis, while an EGFR inhibitor
synergized with LXR agonists in killing cancer cells. Inhibition of
SC4MOL or NSDHL, or activation of LXR by sterol metabolites can be an
effective strategy against carcinomas with activated EGFR-KRAS signaling.
