Title: IKBKE is a substrate of EGFR and a therapeutic target in NSCLCs
with activating mutations of EGFR


EGFR is one of key driver pathways of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
EGFR inhibitors have shown significant response in patients with EGFR
mutation. However, patients develop resistance in short period of time,
which results from secondary EGFRT790M mutation and other mechanisms.
Here, we demonstrated that activating mutations of EGFR significantly
activated IKBKE, an IB kinase family member previously shown to activate
Akt and NF-B pathways. Furthermore, we showed that EGFR directly
interacts with and phosphorylates IKBKE on tyrosine 153 and tyrosine 179
residues. IKBKE-Y153F/179-F, a mutant that could not be phosphorylated by
EGFR, largely reduced its kinase activity and failed to activate Akt and
NF-B as well as inhibited EGFR signaling. Furthermore, phospho-IKBKE-Y153
correlated with EGFR activation in NSCLC patients. Notably, depletion of
IKBKE by either small molecule inhibitor amlexanox or shRNA selectively
inhibited cell viability in NSCLC cells with EGFR mutations. Moreover, we
observed that inhibition of IKBKE led to feedback activation of the MAPK
pathway. Combination of amlexanox with MEK inhibitor AZD6244
significantly inhibits cell survival and tumor growth in NSCLC cells
driven by activating EGFR mutations including EGFRT790M. Thus, our
findings not only identify IKBKE as a direct downstream target of EGFR
but also provide a potential therapeutic strategy for EGFR-TKI resistant
NSCLC driven by secondary EGFR mutation.
