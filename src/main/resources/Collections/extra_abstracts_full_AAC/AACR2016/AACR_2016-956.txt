Title: Anticancer effects of silibinin-induced small nucleolar RNA 11B on
bladder cancer cells


Silibinin is the major active constituent of silymarin, an extract of
milk thistle seeds. Silibinin has been shown to have significant
anti-cancer effects in a variety of malignancies. However, the molecular
mechanisms of silibinin action in bladder cancer have not been reported.
In the present study, we found that silibinin (10 M) significantly
suppressed proliferation and invasion of T24 and UM-UC-3 bladder cancer
cells. We analyzed various pathways as possible mechanisms of silibinin
action using RNA-Seq technology in bladder cancer cell lines. Analysis of
RNA-seq data identified silibinin targets that down-regulate the actin
cytoskeleton pathway. Analysis of RNA-seq data also identified the
mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway as a
silibinin-down-regulated pathway. These pathways were also found to
crosstalk through Ras and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). These
data show that silibinin anti-cancer effects are through down-regulation
of actin cytoskeleton and MAP kinase pathways in bladder cancer. We also
found that silibinin induced small nucleolar RNA 11B (SNORD11B) and that
SNORD11B suppressed proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells.
We will discuss the pathway of the anti-cancer effects of SNORD11B.
