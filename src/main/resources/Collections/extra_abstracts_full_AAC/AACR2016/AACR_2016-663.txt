Title: Factors affecting genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 in mouse model


CRISPR/Cas9 joined genome editing family and became a powerful tool for
cancer researches. While CRISPR is effective for generating knock-out,
knock-in or point mutation animal models, the protocols and success rates
to generate CRISPR mouse model vary significantly among different
laboratories. We examined a series of parameters for generating various
types of mouse models using CRISPR/Cas9. The efficiency and toxicity of
gRNA, Cas9 mRNA and donor concentration, insert size and injection
methods were thoroughly analyzed. We also evaluated strategies generating
conditional knock-out models using CRISPR. The optimized protocols for
successful mouse model generation for knock-in, knock-out, point mutation
and conditional knock-out using CRISPR will be proposed.
