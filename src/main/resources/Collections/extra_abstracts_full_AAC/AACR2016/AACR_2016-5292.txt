Title: An online tool for biomarker analysis in Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) datasets


The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is a public repository of gene
expression and sequence-based datasets, that currently includes >42,000
datasets with gene expression profiles obtained by microarray, and
>12,000 datasets containing the keyword cancer. Although GEO has its own
analysis tool (GEO2R) for identifying differentially expressed genes,
evaluation of a single gene is not straightforward, and GEO2R was not
designed to identify prognostic biomarkers based on survival analyses. In
this work, we describe an online, easy-to-use tool for biomarker analysis
in GEO datasets.shinyGEO is a web-based tool that allows a user to
download the expression and sample data from a GEO dataset, select a gene
of interest, and perform a survival or differential expression analysis
in order to evaluate gene expression diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.
For both analyses, shinyGEO produces publication-ready graphics and
generates R code ensuring that all analyses are reproducible. The tool is
developed using shiny, a web application framework for R, a language for
statistical computing and graphics.The web application and source code is
