Title: Laser micro-irradiations of large amounts of cells for high
content applications


A new methodical approach for the evaluation of photo-manipulated samples
is presented and tested in various biological setups. The method is based
on an atypical setting of a standard laser-scanning microscope (LSM) and
image-processing software solution. Newly, a whole population of several
dozen of cells is simultaneously micro-irradiated by a laser beam in a
precisely defined pattern of collinear rays. Such laser induced striation
pattern is automatically analyzed by specialized software routine
providing quantitative assessment of various photo-manipulations, such as
DNA-damage induced protein translocations or modifications, in both live
and fixed cells. Automation of the process reduces workload and opens new
possibilities for various dynamic studies and/or high content
experiments. Results obtained during the testing of the method are
presented and offer an insight into several DNA damage recognition and
response pathways.
