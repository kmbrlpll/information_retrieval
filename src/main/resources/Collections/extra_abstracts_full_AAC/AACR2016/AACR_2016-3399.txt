Title: CTGF promotes tumor angiogenesis process in osteosarcoma through
induction of angiopoietin-2


Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor.
Angiogenesis is essential for the tumor growth. Angiopoietin-2 (Angpt2)
plays a critical role in angiogenesis and tumor progression. Connective
tissue growth factor (CTGF), a secreted protein that binds to integrins,
modulates the angiogenesis of certain human cancer cells. However, the
effect of CTGF on Angpt2 expression in human osteosarcoma cells is mostly
unknown. In this study, we found that overexpression of CTGF in
osteosarcoma promoted angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo by tube formation
assay, and Matrigel plug assay. Knockdown of CTGF obviously reduced
expression of Angpt2 and angiogenesis. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have
been demonstrated that functions as oncogenes or angiogenesis regulators
in human cancer. Here, we also found that overexpression of CTGF
significantly decreased miR-543 in osteosarcoma cells. Transfection of
miR-543 mimic reduced Angpt2 expression and angiogenesis. Taken together,
CTGF promotes angiogenesis via up-regulation of Angpt2 by decreasing
miR-543 in human osteosarcoma. These findings certify that CTGF functions
as a tumor enhancer gene, suggesting that CTGF may be a potential
therapeutic target for osteosarcoma patients.
