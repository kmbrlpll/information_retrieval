Title: Comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of aberrant WNT signaling
on global gene expression and higher order nuclear structure in human
cells


The organization of the genome in the nucleus is complex and dynamic.
Features of the nuclear architecture, including the spatial arrangement
of genomic sequences, the structure of chromatin, and the accessibility
of regulatory DNA elements modulate nuclear processes such as gene
transcription DNA replication, DNA repair, RNA processing, and mRNA
transport. However, the interplay between nuclear architecture and gene
expression is poorly understood. We propose to elucidate the impact of
silencing the prominent transcription factor, TCF7L2, the major effector
of the WNT signaling pathway, on the transcriptional equilibrium and
nuclear architecture of the nucleus in human colorectal cancer cells. Our
multidisciplinary approach combines targeted silencing of TCF7L2,
3D-FISH, RNA-seq, and Hi-C chromosome conformation capture, in parallel
with mathematical modeling to delineate structure/function relationships
in the interphase nucleus. This approach will elucidate the intricacies
of a dynamic cellular signaling pathway in three-dimensional space.
