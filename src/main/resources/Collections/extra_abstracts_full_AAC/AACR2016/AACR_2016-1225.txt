Title: NVP-HDM201: cellular and in vivo profile of a novel highly potent
and selective PPI inhibitor of p53-Mdm2


Stabilization of p53 protein by preventing its interaction with the
negative regulator Mdm2 leads to selective induction of the p53 pathway,
thus offering a promising cancer therapeutic strategy in p53 wild-type
tumors. In the present study, we show the identification of NVP-HDM201, a
novel, highly optimized, and selective inhibitor of the p53-Mdm2
interaction. NVP-HDM201 activates p53 in human cells and induces robust
p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, selectively in p53
wild-type tumor cells. Its activity and selectivity has been tested and
confirmed across a large panel of cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell
Line Encyclopedia. In vivo, NVP-HDM201 shows a dose-proportional
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and a clear PK/PD relationship, resulting in
tumor growth inhibition and regression in SJSA-1 tumor-bearing rats at
well-tolerated oral (p.o.) doses. The validation and understanding of its
mechanism of action, the overall favorable drug-like properties and the
characterization of its on-target toxicological profile in preclinical
species strongly supported the initiation of Phase I clinical trials with
NVP-HDM201 in pre-selected patients with p53 wild-type tumors.
