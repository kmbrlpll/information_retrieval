Title: Np63 promotes TGF-induced metastasis by silencing a microRNA
network restraining wound healing


Primary cancer cell dissemination is the key event in metastasis, yet
context-specific determinants remain largely undefined. Multiple reports
have suggested an anti-metastatic role for the p53 family member p63
linked to its minor epithelial isoform, TAp63. However, the role and
contribution of the major p63 isoform, Np63, remain largely undefined.
Here we report a distinct and TAp63-independent mechanism in which
Np63-expressing cells, in a TGF-rich microenvironment, are positively
selected for metastatic dissemination. We define the molecular mechanism
of this effect, through Np63-mediated repression of miR-527 and miR-665
and the subsequent upregulation of two TGF pathway major effectors, SMAD4
and TRII. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this mechanism reflects a
fundamental role for Np63 in the normal wound healing response. We show
that Np63 and miR-527/665 control the TGF-dependent signaling that
switches off anti-migratory miR-198 by downregulating the regulatory
factor KSRP. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel microRNA network
orchestrated selectively by Np63 that is involved in the physiological
regulation of wound healing but is hijacked by tumors to promote
metastatic dissemination.
