Title: A new RAS G12D specific rabbit polyclonal antibody for
immunohistochemical FFPE application


Background: Determining RAS mutation status is considered as prognostic
factor for colorectal cancer patients in anti-epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) antibody therapy. Because genetic testing remains costly
and time-consuming, it is necessary to develop mutation specific antibody
for immunological analysis. However RAS G12D mutation antibody for
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining is not available.Results: Here we
report a novel RAS G12D rabbit polyclonal antibody (GTX132407) for
immunochemistry (IHC) testing, which was developed by cooperating with
GeneTex In. Based on analyzing 15 clinical colorectal cancer specimens,
the result of IHC staining using RAS G12D mutation specific antibody
(GTX132407) was correlated with genetic testing of RAS G12D mutation
using ultra-sensitive total RAS mutation screen kit [Hong Jing
Biotechnology Inc. (FemtoPath)].Conclusion: In summary, the result showed
that IHC testing with RAS G12D specific mutation antibody could be a
reliable tool for predicting RAS genetic mutation status.
