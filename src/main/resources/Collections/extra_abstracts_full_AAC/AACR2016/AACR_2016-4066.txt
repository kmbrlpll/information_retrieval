Title: The chemokine CXCL13 in lung cancers associated with environmental
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pollution


More than 90% of lung cancers are caused by cigarette smoke and air
pollution, with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as key
carcinogens. In Xuanwei City of Yunnan Province the lung cancer incidence
is among the highest in China attributed to smoky coal
combustion-generated PAH pollution. Here we screened for abnormal
inflammatory factors in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) from Xuanwei
and control regions (CR) where smoky coal was not used, and found that a
chemokine CXCL13 was overexpressed in 63/70 (90%) of Xuanwei NSCLCs and
44/71 (62%) of smoker and 27/60 (45%) of non-smoker CR patients. CXCL13
overexpression was associated with the region Xuanwei and cigarette
smoke. The key carcinogen bezo(a)pyrene (BaP) induced CXCL13 production
in lung epithelial cells and in mice prior to development of detectable
lung cancer. Deficiency in Cxcl13 or its receptor, Cxcr5, attenuated
BaP-induced lung cancer in mice, demonstrating CXCL13's critical role in
PAH-induced lung carcinogenesis.
