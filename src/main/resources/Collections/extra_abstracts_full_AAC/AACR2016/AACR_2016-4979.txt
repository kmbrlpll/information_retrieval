Title: Cabozantinib eradicates advanced murine prostate cancer by
activating neutrophil-mediated anti-tumor innate immunity


Several kinase inhibitors targeting aberrant signaling pathways in tumor
cells have been deployed in cancer therapy. However, their impact on the
tumor immune microenvironment remains poorly understood. The tyrosine
kinase inhibitor cabozantinib showed striking responses in cancer
clinical trial patients across several malignancies. Here we show that
cabozantinib rapidly eradicates invasive, poorly-differentiated PTEN/p53
deficient murine prostate cancer. This was associated with enhanced
release of neutrophil chemotactic factors from tumor cells, including
CXCL12 and HMGB1, resulting in robust infiltration of neutrophils into
the tumor. Critically, cabozantinib-induced tumor clearance in mice was
abolished by antibody-mediated granulocyte depletion or HMGB1
neutralization or blockade of neutrophil chemotaxis with the CXCR4
inhibitor, plerixafor. Collectively, these data demonstrate that
cabozantinib triggers a neutrophil-mediated anti-tumor innate immune
response, resulting in rapid tumor clearance.
