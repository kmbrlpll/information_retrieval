Title: Bromodomain inhibition of the transcriptional coactivators
CBP/EP300 as a therapeutic strategy to target the IRF4 network in
multiple myeloma


Pharmacological inhibition of chromatin co-regulatory factors represents
a clinically validated strategy to modulate oncogenic signaling through
selective attenuation of gene expression. We demonstrate that CBP/EP300
bromodomain inhibition preferentially abrogates the viability of multiple
myeloma cell lines. Selective targeting of multiple myeloma cell lines
through CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is the result of direct
transcriptional suppression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription
factor IRF4, which is essential for the viability of myeloma cells, and
the concomitant repression of the IRF4 target gene c-MYC. Ectopic
expression of either IRF4 or MYC antagonizes the phenotypic and
transcriptional effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition, highlighting
the IRF4/MYC axis as a key component of its mechanism of action. These
findings suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition represents a
viable therapeutic strategy for targeting multiple myeloma and other
lymphoid malignancies dependent on the IRF4 network.
