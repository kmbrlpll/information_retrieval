Title: Super-transactivation TP53 variant in the germline of a family
with Li-Fraumeni variant


Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant familial cancer
syndrome, characterized by multiple malignancies and frequent germline
alterations in TP53. In this study, we highlight four unclassified exonic
p53 variants detected in patients with a suspected diagnosis of LFS. We
report for the first time the discovery of two novel functional variants
in codons 191(c.572C>G; p.P191R) and 360 (c.1079G>T; p.G360V), located,
respectively, in the DNA binding domain and in a linker region near the
tetramerization domain of TP53. Our data revealed that while the P191R
variant decreased the transactivation levels of several p53 targets, it
failed to segregate with the disease state. The G360V variant, on the
other hand, behaved in a paradoxical fashion by causing a stark
upregulation in the activity of several p53 response elements. This tumor
suppressive effect was also observed at the level of colony formation and
c-Caspase 3 activation. While unlikely to be disease-causing, we propose
that these variants may represent novel p53 polymorphisms and potential
phenotypic modifiers in LFS. In the future, the enhanced transactivation
effects of G360V-p53 may also prove useful in designing more efficacious
p53-based gene therapies.
