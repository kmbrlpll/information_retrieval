Title: RUNX3 inhibits metastasis and angiogenesis in colorectal cancer


Recent studies proved that an inactivation of RUNX3 (runt-related
transcription factor-3) expression is highly associated with lymph node
metastasis and poor prognosis in various cancer types. However, the
mechanism of RUNX3-mediated suppression of tumor metastasis remains
unclear. Herein, we aimed to clarify the effect of RUNX3 on metastasis
and angiogenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). First, we found that the
reduction of expression of RUNX3 in CRC tissues when compared with tumor
adjacent normal colon tissues, as indicated by reduced RUNX3 staining,
was significantly correlated with TNM stage. Second, we demonstrated that
RUNX3 overexpression inhibited CRC cell migration and invasion resulting
from the elevated upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9
(MMP-2 and MMP-9) expression. In contrast, the knockdown of RUNX3 reduced
the inhibition of migration and invasion of CRC cells. Last, Vascular
endothelial growth factor(VEGF) is an inducer of angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis. We found that restoration of RUNX3 decreased vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and suppressed endothelial
cell growth and tube formation in CRC cells. Taken together, our data
demonstrated that RUNX3 may provide insights into the development of
RUNX3 for CRC metastasis diagnostics and therapeutics.
