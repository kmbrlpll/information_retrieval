Title: The genomic landscape and clinical relevance of A-to-I RNA editing
in human cancers


Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a widespread
post-transcriptional mechanism, but its genomic landscape and clinical
relevance in cancer have not been investigated systematically. We
characterized the global A-to-I RNA editing profiles of >6000 patient
samples of 20 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and revealed a
striking diversity of altered RNA-editing patterns in tumors relative to
normal tissues. We identified an appreciable number of clinically
relevant editing events, many of which are in noncoding regions. We
experimentally demonstrated the functional effects of several RNA editing
events and provide the evidence that RNA editing could selectively affect
drug sensitivity. These results highlight RNA editing as an exciting
theme for investigating cancer mechanisms, biomarkers and treatments.
