Title: Enhancer templated RNAs as predictors of therapeutic response to
epigenetic therapy


Colon tumors arise in a stepwise fashion from either discrete genetic
perturbations or epigenetic dysregulation. To uncover the key epigenetic
regulators that drive colon cancer growth, we utilized a CRISPR loss of
function screen and identified a number of essential genes, including the
Bromodomain and Extraterminal (BET) protein, BRD4. We find BRD4 is
critical for colon cancer proliferation and its loss leads to
differentiation effects in vivo. JQ1, a BET inhibitor, preferentially
reduced growth in a subset of epigenetically dysregulated colon cancers,
characterized by the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Integrated
transcriptomic and genomic analyses defined a distinct super-enhancer in
CIMP(+) colon cancers that regulates cMYC transcription. We find that the
CCAT1 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is transcribed from this
super-enhancer and is exquisitely sensitive to BET inhibition.
Concordantly, cMYC transcription and cell growth were tightly correlated
with the presence of CCAT1 RNA in a variety of tumor types. Taken
together, we propose CCAT1 as a clinically tractable biomarker for
identifying patients likely to benefit from BET inhibitors.
