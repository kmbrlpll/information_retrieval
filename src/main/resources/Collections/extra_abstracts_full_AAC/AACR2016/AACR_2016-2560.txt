Title: Significant association between a fatty acid-related genetic
variant and the risk of lung cancer


Systematically study the metabolism can help us understand the etiology
of diseases. Recent metabolism GWAS provided us a chance to explore the
association between serum metabolites and risk of diseases through
genetic instruments. Based on the idea of mendelian randomization, we
studied the associations between metabolites-related SNPs and lung cancer
risk in 13,945 cases and 12,939 controls. We identified a fatty acid (FA)
related SNP that was significantly associated with lung cancer risk (odd
ratio (OR) = 0.87, P = 1.7610-15) and this effect was stronger in
females. We further validated a significant association between this SNP
and serum levels of this FA (Beta = -0.57, P = 1.6810-3) in 253 Chinese
healthy individuals by LC-MS system. The association between the SNP and
the expression of FA-related gene was also observed in the liver tissues
(Beta = -0.84, P = 6.4910-3). Together, we organized a mendelian
randomization study which provided a FA related SNP as a female
concentrated and smoke independent genetic determinant of lung cancer
from the aspect of metabolites and proposed that higher level of this FA
was a causal risk factor of lung cancer.
