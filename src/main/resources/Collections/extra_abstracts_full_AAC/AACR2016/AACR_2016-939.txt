Title: Cell-free DNA associated with extracellular vesicle: Biomarker or
bioactivity


Extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes transfer bioactive cargo,
including proteins and nucleic acids. Recently, EVs associated DNA were
shown to be surrogate biomarker present in body fluids harboring various
oncogenic mutations. Cell-free, extracellular DNA is reported in cell
cultures and many body fluids, but its relative location in relation to
EVs and function is not known. Our study demonstrates that DNase
sensitive nucleic acids were present on the surface of EV isolates from
mast cell lines. Association of EV-DNA was revealed by increase of zeta
potential and particle number upon DNase treatment. Additionally,
cytoplasmic DNA traces were found in recipient mesenchymal stem cell
after EVs treatment. In conclusion, we define that surface association of
DNA with EVs that could regulate recipient cellular function.
