Title: CEBPD induces apoptosis through autophagy in metformin-treated HCC


The patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) face the risk of cancer
relapse or liver dysfunction. Metformin (Met), a first-line drug of type
2 diabetes, has been proved that it could induce G1 arrest and prevent or
inhibit HCC. Previously, we demonstrated that the transcription factor
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (CEBPD) plays a tumor suppressor and
is responsive to many anticancer drugs in HCC. In this study, we found
that Met could induce autophagy, growth arrest and further apoptosis in
Huh7 cells. Met enhanced CEBPD expression via stabilizing its protein
stability. The loss of CEBPD attenuated the Met-induced autophagy, growth
arrest and apoptosis. Importantly, in addition to increasing P27 and
down-regulating cyclin D1, CEBPD also contributed the increases of LC3B
and ATG3 and LC3 puncta formation. We revealed a novel involvement of
CEBPD in Met-induced growth arrest, apoptosis and autophagy of liver
cancer cells through regulating p27, cyclinD1, LC3B and ATG3.
