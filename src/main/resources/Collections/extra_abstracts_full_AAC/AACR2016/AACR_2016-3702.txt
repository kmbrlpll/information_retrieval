Title: Src phosphorylated Mdm2 requires MdmX to act as a neddylating
ligase


Mdm2 is an oncoprotein and, along with its family member MdmX, have been
shown to be elevated in human cancers. Like Mdm2, MdmX, is a RING
containing protein, yet it lacks intrinsic E3 ligase function. Mdm2 has
been shown to facilitate ubiquitination as a monomer, a homodimer, and as
a heterodimer with MdmX depending on the cellular stress. Our recent
report establishes that under growth conditions that activate Src, Mdm2
functions as a neddylating enzyme. Whether MdmX is necessary for Mdm2 to
neddylate p53 has yet to be shown. Here we demonstrate that Src
phosphorylation results in increased levels of MdmX, increased binding
between Mdm2 and MdmX, and increased neddylation of MdmX and p53.
Interestingly, the lack of MdmX (in transient assays or in shRNA cell
lines) results in decreased neddylation of p53. These data support a
critical role for MdmX as part of the Mdm2 neddylating complex.
