Title: Evaluation of LGR5 protein expression in colon cancer stem cells


Cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of cancer cells responsible for
cancer initiation, development and metastasis. A number of studies
demonstrated that Leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein-coupled
receptor 5 (LGR5) can drive cancer development through triggering
canonical Wnt signaling and its downstream gene expression. LGR5 is an
important biomarker specifically expressed on colon cancer stem cells. In
this study, we have successfully developed an LGR5 antibody with high
specificity to detect endogenous LGR5 expression in different immunoassay
application.By screening multiple anti-LGR5 hybridoma clones, antibody
generated by clone UMAB212 was proven to be highly specific on our high
density protein microarray chip assay. Here our experimental data
demonstrated that clone UMAB212 recognizes not only human LGR5 protein
but also mouse LGR5 protein in both western blot and flow cytometry
applications. No cross-reactivity was observed with the other two LGR
family members, LGR4 and LGR6. Furthermore, this antibody also works
great on immunohistochemistry application on FFPE tissue blocks. In
summary, UMAB212 is great tool for us to study LGR5 protein in different
immunoassay setting and it could also be a potential cancer diagnostic
reagent.
