Title: Pentraxin 3 is responsive to the activation of CCAAT/enhancer
binding delta and promotes cancer progression in the tumor
microenvironment


This lack of understanding especially impacts the design of anticancer
treatments. It is a common observation in the clinic that recurrent
cancers, and particularly anticancer drug-resistant cancers, are more
difficult to treat because they spread faster than the original tumor.
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD) was activated in M2
macrophages and myofibroblasts/cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and
contributed to metastasis, invasion and recurrence of cancer cells in
response to PGE2 and the anticancer drugs. We further found that
pentraxin 3 (PTX3) was activated in response to CEBPD induction and
involved in migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, and the same
phenomenon was also observed in drug-resistant cancers. Interestingly, we
found that a recombinant PTX3 protein containing the C-terminal region
(pPTX3) showed an opposite tumorigenic effect to the mammalian PTX3. The
results suggest that PTX3 could be a promising target for preventing the
metastasis/invasion of cancers and treating drug-resistant cancers.
