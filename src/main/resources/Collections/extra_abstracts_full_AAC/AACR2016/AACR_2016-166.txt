Title: Optimizing the detection of subclonal somatic variants with VarDict


Detection of somatic variants in tumor tissues is far from a solved
problem. Heterogenous tumor materials complicate variant assessment in
low frequency subclonal populations, which can play an important role in
the development of drug resistance. Loss of heterozygosity, copy number
variation and other ploidy changes can further change the expected
distribution of variant metrics.We demonstrate improvements in the
specificity and sensitivity of variant calling algorithms by optimising
linear combinations of widely used filtering criteria such as allelic
frequency, depth and p-value distributions. We specifically improve SNP
and indels from the freely available VarDict caller
(https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/VarDictJava) and show that these
optimisations can be generalised across a wide range of allelic
frequencies. We validate our findings against synthetic and in vitro
standards such as the ICGC-TCGA DREAM challenge truth set. Our proposed
filtering strategy is widely applicable to other variant callers, and the
updated filters for VarDict dramatically improve sensitivity and
precision on low frequency variants which are crucial for our ability to
reconstruct likely tumor populations from short read sequencing data and
to study tumor evolution.
