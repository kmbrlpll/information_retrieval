Title: MDM2 but not MDM4 promotes retinoblastoma cell proliferation
through p53-independent regulation of MYCN translation


Retinoblastomas can arise from cone photoreceptor precursors in response
to the loss of pRB function. Some aspects of cone precursor-specific
circuitry cooperate with pRB loss to initiate this process and
subsequently continue to contribute to the malignancy. Intrinsic high
level MDM2 expression is a key component of this circuitry and is thought
to inactivate p53-mediated tumor surveillance that could otherwise be
induced by aberrant cell cycle entry. However, the MDM2-related MDM4 has
also been proposed to abrogate p53-mediated tumor surveillance in the
absence of detectable MDM2. Here we report that high-level MDM2 but not
MDM4 has a consistent, critical role in retinoblastoma cell
proliferation. Reduction of MDM2 and MDM4 only weakly induced p53, yet
reduction of MDM2 but not MDM4 severely impaired proliferation and
survival through a p53-independent mechanism. Specifically, MDM2
up-regulated the translation of another component of the cone circuitry,
MYCN, in retinoblastoma cells. These findings indicate that high-level
MDM2 expression is needed in order to perform a critical p53-independent
function and may obviate the need for genomic alterations to the p53
pathway in retinoblastoma cells.
