Title: The role of the metal scaffold in the development of cytotoxic
metal complexes


Multiple cytotoxic metal compounds are known, but structure activity
relationships can be difficult to determine in these complex molecules.
It is tempting to generalize the activity or off-target effects of the
compounds to being related to the identity of the metal, or
alternatively, to some specific active ligand features, but this is a
misleading oversimplification that can slow the development of new
therapeutics. In this presentation a systematic study of the impact of
the metal center, one specific active ligand, and the inactive coligands
that create the metal scaffold will be presented. There is clear evidence
that each component plays a role in both desired and potentially
deleterious off-target activities, providing the opportunity to adjust
each of these three components independently to generate optimized
potential anti-cancer agents.
