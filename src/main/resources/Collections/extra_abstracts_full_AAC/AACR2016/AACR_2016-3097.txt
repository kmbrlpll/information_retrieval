Title: Structural and biophysical characterization of anti-apoptotic
protein Bcl-2 and GTPase Rac1 interaction


We have recently reported a novel mechanism linking the pro-oxidant
activity of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 to its interaction with the
small GTPase Rac1. In this current study, we investigate the nature of
this interaction using activated (GTP loaded) Rac1 and Bcl-2 peptides
(spanning the BH3 domain and its adjacent loop region) using
coimmunoprecipitation, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), X-ray
crystallography, docking/modeling, fluorescence spectroscopy, molecular
dynamics and mutational studies. Our results will develop to
translational relevance in the treatment of human cancers that are
refractory to chemotherapy due to overexpression of Bcl-2.
