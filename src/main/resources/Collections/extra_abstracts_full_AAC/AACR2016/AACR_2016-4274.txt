Title: Porcine ovarian matrix supports maintenance of human intestinal
organoid cultures


Currently, extracellular matrix hydrogels derived from the
Engelbreth-Holmes-Swarm murine tumor (Cultrex BME, Matrigel) are used for
stem cell maintenance and differentiation of both normal and tumor
organoid culture models. While this matrix is suitable for many in vitro
applications, there is increasing demand for a 3D organoid culture
platform that is more suitable for clinical applications. Here, we have
developed a soluble extracellular matrix derived from normal porcine
ovaries that forms a hydrogel polymer at physiological temperature and
that supports maintenance of human small intestine organoids in culture.
This matrix supports expansion of LGR5+ human stem cell populations using
Wnt, EGF, Noggin, and R-Spondin 1 cell culture medium. The matrix also
supports differentiation of stem cells into mini organs by removing Wnt
which is characterized by the formation of intestinal crypts which
exhibit immunostaining for lineage specific markers. This new
extracellular matrix hydrogel represents a non-tumor sourced, normal
extracellular matrix for evaluating both development and cancer
progression.
