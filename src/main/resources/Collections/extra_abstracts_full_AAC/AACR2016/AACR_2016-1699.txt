Title: Protumoral role of trans fatty acid in colorectal cancer


Trans fatty acids (TFAs) is a recent focus of health problems. TFA is a
definitive risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and the death. TFA is
also possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, obesity, diabetes,
fatty liver, and ovulation infertility. Relation of TFA with carcinogenic
risk is controversy; however, TFA is reported to increase the risk of
breast cancer and prostate cancer. Elaidic acid (EA), a trans form of
oleic acid, enhances cancer cell growth, invasion, and anti-apoptotic
survival. By animal models, EA promotes tumor growth and metastasis to
the lung, liver, and peritoneum. EA induces stemness in cancer cells
through transactivation of EFGR via SRC from GPR40/120 as receptors in
EA-integrated cholesterol raft. Activated EGFR relays the signals to
activate canonical and non-canonical wnt pathway and to inactivate notch1
pathways. EA also increases miR-494, which inhibits cell differentiation
through decrease of target genes. Continuous EA feeding with dosage
alteration increased cancer cell stemness. EA diminishes the efficiency
of 5-fluorouracil by increase of residual cancer stem cells. These
findings suggest that TFA is a relevant cancer promoting factor. Decision
of removal of TFA from foods by FDA might provide an impact to cancer
clinics.
