Title: Dual role of EpCAM cleavage in adhesion attenuation and
transcription enhancement for cell migration


Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a membrane protein known to
modulate cell-cell adhesion, is also a regulatory molecule internalized
into the nucleus for transcriptional control of gene expression. Here we
demonstrate that activated EGF/EGFR is a signaling factor to drive the
cleavage of the extracellular fragment EpEX culminating in removal of
cell-surface EpCAM as monitored with recognition atomic force microscopy
(AFM). As a result, internalization of the cytoplasmic domain EpICD leads
to formation of transcription factor complexes with LEF1 that regulate
gene transcription for enhancing mobility functions of cancer cells.
Comprehensive probing with AFM further reveals increased elasticity and
decreased adhesiveness of these cells, implicating acquisition of an
epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype. While EpCAM cleavage
contributes to the loss of cell-surface adhesiveness, its internalized
EpICD additionally regulates targets for promoting cell migration. Thus,
this EGF/EGFR-modulated action on structural EpCAM and regulatory EpICD
can enhance invasion potential of transformed cells.
