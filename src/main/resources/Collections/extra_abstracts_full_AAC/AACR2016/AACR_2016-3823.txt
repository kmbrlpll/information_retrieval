Title: Staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing 1 (SND1) in
development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma


Staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing 1 (SND1) is
identified as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and
overexpression of SND1 has been correlated with HCC progression. Here, we
present effect of liver specific overexpression of human SND1 in a novel
transgenic mouse model. We observe greater tumor load and tumor volume in
transgenic mice than wildtype mice, when subjected to chemical
carcinogenesis. Approximately 30% of transgenic animals manifest
spontaneous tumorigenesis with age. Liver specific expression of cancer
stem cell markers such as EpCAM and CD133 as well as inflammatory markers
was found to be higher in transgenic mice. SND1 overexpressing
hepatocytes show increased activation of insulin and NFB signaling
pathways compared to wildtype hepatocytes. However, no significant
differences in liver weight or liver function was noted among transgenic
and wildtype animals. Overall, our findings confirm that overexpression
of SND1 in vivo plays a vital role in development and progression of HCC.
Thus, molecular targeting of SND1 seems to be potential therapeutic
intervention for HCC management in patients.
