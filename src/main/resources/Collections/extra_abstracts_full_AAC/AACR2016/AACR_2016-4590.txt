Title: Mechanism of PI3K activation by the HER3/ErbB3 receptor


Human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3, also known as ErbB3) is a
receptor tyrosine kinase that lacks catalytic activity but is essential
for cellular homeostasis due to its ability to allosterically activate
its heterodimeric partners, EGFR and HER2 (also known as HER1/ErbB1 and
ErbB2, respectively). HER3 is an important therapeutic cancer target
because the signaling emanating from HER3 heterodimers is critical for
the progression and maintenance of several human epithelial malignancies.
This is primarily due to the potent ability of HER3 to recruit and
activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). This ability has been
attributed to the presence of multiple direct binding sites for PI3K
located in the intracellular tail of HER3. The advantage of having
multiple recruitment sites is unclear and our recent data show that they
provide little advantage to the ability of HER3 to activate PI3K. In
addition, we have identified an alternative mode by which HER3 can
activate PI3K, demonstrating a complex mechanism by which HER3
phosphorylation is coupled to activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
Our results have important implications for therapeutic targeting of a
number of human cancers in which HER3/PI3K signaling axis is abnormally
activated and contributes to disease progression.
