Title: Deregulated Myc is an immunosuppressive switch


Early tumor evolution through sustained oncogene activity selectively
bypasses the engagement of cell-intrinsic tumor-suppressor signaling and
cell-extrinsic microenvironmental restrictions. How the immune system may
be involved is virtually unknown. We describe here the contributions of a
conditional and reversible low-level expression of Myc in a mouse model
of KrasG12D-driven non-small cell lung cancer. Deregulated Myc activity
results in highly expansive tumors that appear embedded in inflamed
regions and leads to a rapid reduction of mouse survival. Myc activation
imposes an immediate switch to an immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic
microenvironment, facilitated through IL23- and CCL9-associated
recruitment of PD-L1 loaded macrophages and local exclusion of
T-lymphocytes. Reversibly, blocking the activity of Myc-driven IL23 and
CCL9 expression or withdrawal of deregulated Myc activity in tumors
established by oncogene cooperation results in tumor cell death and
regression, associated with a collapse of the established
microenvironmental changes and re-engagement of cytotoxic T-cells. During
oncogene cooperation with Ras, deregulated Myc directs a sufficient and
necessary switch to a microenvironment that shields tumor growth and
expansion from immune suppression.
