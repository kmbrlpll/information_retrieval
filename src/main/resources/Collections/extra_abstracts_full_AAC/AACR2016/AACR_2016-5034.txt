Title: Overexpression of MYST4 induces tumor progression in
hepatocellular carcinoma


MYST4 is a member of histone acetyltransferases which are involved in
transcriptional activation of genes important for cellular growth and
development. Our previous study revealed that overexpression of MYST4 in
ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma correlated with worse survival. To
further explore the role of MYST4 in human cancers, we selected hepatoma
cell line Huh 7 due to its high level of MYST4 expression among various
cancer cell lines tested. Immunohistochemical study showed that
overexpression of MYST4 correlated with worse overall survival in
hepatoceullular carcinoma (P = 0.02). Furthermore, tumor cells at
invasion front and in lymphovascular spaces are frequently overexpressed.
Knockdown of MYST4 in Huh 7 resulted in significantly reduced cellular
growth, migration and perturbed cell cycle progression. Mouse xenograft
model revealed that MYST4-knockdown Huh 7 cells had lower growth rate,
consistent with the in vitro findings. Together, our studies suggest that
MYST4 promotes cell growth, migration and lymphovascular spread in
hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, MYST4 may serve as a druggable target in
treating hepatocellular carcinoma.
