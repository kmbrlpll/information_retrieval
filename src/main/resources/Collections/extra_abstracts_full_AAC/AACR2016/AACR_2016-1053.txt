Title: Redirecting abiraterone metabolism to biochemically fine tune
prostate cancer therapy


Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in men and Abiraterone is
used for castration resistant prostate cancer therapy by suppressing
androgen production. In patients, abiraterone is converted to D4A, a
novel metabolite with more potent anti-tumor activity and structural
similarities to endogenous steroidal 5-reductase substrates, such as
testosterone. Here, we show that D4A is further metabolized by the
related steroidogenic enzymes to at least 3 5-reduced and 3 5-reduced
metabolites. The initial 5-reduced metabolite, 3-keto-5-abi, is more
abundant than D4A in patients taking abiraterone, and is an androgen
receptor (AR) agonist, which promotes prostate cancer progression. In a
clinical trial with patients taking abiraterone alone, followed by
abiraterone plus dutasteride (a 5-reductase inhibitor), 3-keto-5-abi and
downstream metabolites are depleted by dutasteride, while D4A
concentrations rise, effectively blocking production of a tumor promoting
metabolite and permitting D4A accumulation. Our findings suggest a
previously unappreciated and biochemically specific method of clinically
fine tuning abiraterone metabolism to optimize therapy.
