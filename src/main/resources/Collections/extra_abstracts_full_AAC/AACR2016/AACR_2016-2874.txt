Title: Genetic suppression reveals DNA repair-independent antagonism
between BRCA1 and COBRA1 in mammary gland development


Breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is well known for its function in
double strand break (DSB) DNA repair. While BRCA1 is also implicated in
transcriptional regulation, the physiological significance remains
unclear. Cofactor of BRCA1 (COBRA1) is a BRCA1-binding protein and an
important regulator of transcription elongation. Here we used mouse
genetics to interrogate functional interaction between BRCA1 and COBRA1
during mammary gland development. Tissue-specific deletion of Cobra1
reduced mammary epithelial compartments and blocked ductal morphogenesis,
alveologenesis, and lactogenesis, demonstrating a pivotal role of COBRA1
in adult tissue development. Remarkably, these developmental deficiencies
due to Cobra1 knockout were largely rescued by additional loss of
full-length Brca1. Furthermore, Brca1/Cobra1 double knockout restored
developmental transcription at puberty, altered luminal epithelial
homeostasis, yet remained deficient in homologous recombination-based DSB
repair. Thus our genetic suppression analysis uncovers a previously
unappreciated, DNA repair-independent function of BRCA1 in antagonizing
COBRA1-dependent transcription program during mammary gland development.
