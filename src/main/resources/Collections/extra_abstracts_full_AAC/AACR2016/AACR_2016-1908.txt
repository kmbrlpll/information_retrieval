Title: Lung tumorigenesis and metastasis is suppressed by the
miR-200-GATA4/6-BMP4 axis


MicroRNA-200 (miR-200) family members suppress the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition of various cancer cells, including lung adenocarcinoma cells.
Previously, we found that forced expression of miR-200 decreased bone
morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). In this study, we explored the mechanism
and role of BMP4 depletion by miR-200 in murine lung adenocarcinoma
cells. miR-200 down-regulated BMP4 via direct targeting of the GATA4 and
GATA6 transcription factors that stimulate Bmp4 transcription. Bmp4
knockdown suppressed cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion and
inhibited tumorigenesis and metastasis of lung cancer cells when injected
into syngeneic mice. In addition, BMP4 was required for normal sphere
formation in Matrigel 3-D culture, which might be mediated by MYH10, a
downstream target of BMP4. These findings suggest that BMP4 functions as
a pro-tumorigenic factor in a murine lung cancer model, and its
transcription is regulated by miR-200 and GATA4/6.
