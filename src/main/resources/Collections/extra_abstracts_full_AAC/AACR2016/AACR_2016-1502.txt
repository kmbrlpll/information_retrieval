Title: Three intrinsic subtypes of prostate cancer with distinct pathway
activation profiles differ in prognosis and treatment response


In the era of precision medicine, genomic classifications of prostate
cancer (PC) have not broadly impacted patient care. Here we present an
integrative transcriptome analysis of 14 disease-related pathways in over
4,600 clinical specimens and 25 PC preclinical models. This approach
provides a novel classification scheme, inclusive of 3 PC subtypes
(PCS1-3), which predict disease progression and drug resistance. The PCS1
and PCS2 categories possess characteristics of luminal cells, while PCS3
exhibits basal features. Castration-resistant and metastatic cancers are
over-represented in PCS1 and PCS3 tumors. All 3 subtypes are represented
in commonly used PC cell lines; however, none of the mouse models we
analyzed resembles PCS3. PCS classification using RNA expression data
appears to be stable across primary and metastatic human tumors, cell
lines, xenografts and mouse models. This new subtyping method provides
novel opportunities for patient stratification that reflect specific
features of tumor biology and may influence therapeutic decisions.
