Title: Non-metabolic function of asparagine in regulating global protein
translation


Cancer cells rely on extracellular glutamine for growth and survival.
Previously, we showed that asparagine, a nonessential amino acid that can
be synthesized de novo from glutamine, is both necessary and sufficient
for glutamine-dependent cell survival. In addition, asparagine synthetase
(ASNS) expression positively correlates with the progression of the
disease in human glioma patients, suggesting a critical role of
asparagine during tumor progression. Interestingly, mammalian cells
cannot catabolize asparagine for use as either a nitrogen source or a
bioenergetic substrate, potentially due to the loss of asparaginase
activity during evolution. Ectopic expression of yeast or zebrafish
asparaginase restores the capacity of mammalian cells to utilize
asparagine as both bioenergetic and biosynthetic substrates to support
cell growth. Furthermore, asparagine restores translation of
fast-turn-over proteins under glutamine starvation. Together, the data
suggests that asparagine has been evolved to be a metabolic reserve to
regulate cellular adaptation to nonessential amino acid limitation in
mammalian cells and is therefore a potential target for cancer therapy.
