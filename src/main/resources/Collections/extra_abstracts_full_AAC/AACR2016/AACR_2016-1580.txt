Title: Cancer-associated fibroblasts potentiates tumor relapse after
radiotherapy


Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major component of cancer
stromal cells, about 4050% of total cell population in cancer. Our data
show that CAFs are distributed into larger area than tumor image revealed
by MRI or CT since MRI- or CT- images only represent the core region
containing cancer cells. Although the image-guided stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT) can precisely deliver radiation does to cancers
and decreases radiation side effects, compared to the conventional
external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), the data from our retrospective study
showed that cancer recurrence including local and remote in patients with
conventional EBRT was more frequent than patients with SBRT, and the
survival time of patients with EBRT was also longer than patients with
SBRT. We also demonstrated that CAFs could promote cancer cells recovery
from radiation-induced damage through secreting cytokines/chemokines and
exporting intermediate metabolites, which induce cancer cell dormancy and
enhance DNA damage repair capacity.
