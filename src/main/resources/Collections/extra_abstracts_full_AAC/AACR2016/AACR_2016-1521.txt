Title: Transcriptional networks of the normal human kidney


The kidney is a complex but highly structured organ composed of more than
20 different cell types. Disturbances among these cell types leads to a
plethora of diseases of acute or chronic type, some of which are life
threatening. In addition, kidney cancer represents about 3 percent of all
malignancies. Considerable efforts have been made to profile the
different cell types of the kidney. However, these are mainly based on
studies in rodents. In the current study we present a method, called
composition based cellular stratification that define gene signatures
specific to different cell types and regions of the kidney. The method
uses correlation-based analyses of gene expression microarrays of needle
core biopsies obtained from histologically normal kidney tissues. For
example, a HNF-driven gene expression signatures of proximal tubuli cells
could be defined. This signature was validated in publically available
data at the gene expression as well as at the protein level. We employ
these gene expression signatures as a framework to study expressional
changes observed in renal cell carcinoma, thus increasing the possibility
to pin-point cell specific alterations associated with the transformation
of renal epithelial cells.
