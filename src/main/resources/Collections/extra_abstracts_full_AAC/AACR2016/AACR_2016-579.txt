Title: Antibody drug conjugates (anti-CD79b-vc-MMAE, Polatuzumab Vedotin)
exhibit enhanced cell death targeted to CD79b+ Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and
primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL)


Background: Mature B-NHL, including Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and primary
mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (PMBL) express CD79b+ and have an
excellent prognosis with chemo-immunotherapy (Cairo et al Blood,
2007,Goldman/Cairo et al. Leukemia, 2013, Gerrard/Cairo et al.Blood,
2013). However, a subset of patients with relapsed/refractory mature
B-NHL has chemoimmunotherapy resistant disease a dismal prognosis ( 10% 5
years, EFS) (Cairo et al. JCO, 2012, Miles/Cairo et al. BJH, 2012). The
anti-CD79b-vc-MMAE antibody drug conjugates (Polatuzumab Vedotin, PV) has
demonstrated significant preclinical activity against indolent CD79b+NHL
(Polson et. al.Can. Res. 2009, Dornan et al. Blood, 2009). More recently
PV has been safe and well tolerated in adult with CD79b refractory NHL
(Palanca-Wessels et al. Lancet oncol, 2015) but its preclinical activity
against mature BL/PMBL is unknown.Objective: To determine the efficacy of
ADC (anti-CD79b-vc-MMAE) against RTX sensitive/resistant CD79+ BL and
PMBL tumor cell lines in-vitro.Methods: BL: Raji/Raji4RH (provided by M.
Barth, Roswell Park Cancer Institute) and PMBL: Karpas1106p and MedB-1
were cultured in RPMI with 10 or 20% FBS. Tumor cells were incubated with
hu anti- CD79b-vc-MMAE, and/or anti-CD79b, MMAE or huIgG1 (generously
supplied by Genentech Inc.) for 24 hrs. Cell death was evaluated by
staining with annexin V/7AAD and cell proliferation was analyzed by
alamar blue by flow-cytometry, n = 3.Results: Hu- anti -CD79b-vc-MMAE
compared to hu anti-CD79b Ab or control hu IgG1 Ab alone (10g/ml, 24hrs),
significantly enhanced cell death (apoptosis) in Raji, 47.21.3% vs
29.16.0% vs. 28.24.3%, (p = 0.0008 and p = 0.00006), Raji4RH, 29.89.1% vs
25.43.9% vs. 18.08.2% (p = NS and p = 0.03), Karpas1106p, 46.85.3% vs
33.83.5% vs. 26.20.4% (p = 0.02 and 0.006) and MedB-1, 47.42.2% vs
27.62.4% vs. 23.91.7% (p = 0.002 and 0.0001), respectively. Hu anti-
CD79b-vc-MMAE also significantly reduced cell proliferation compared to
hu anti- CD79b Ab or control hu anti -IgG1 Ab alone (20g/ml, 24hrs).
Raji, 56.15.1% vs 38.10.7% vs. 14.80.4% (p = 0.001 and p = 0.0008),
Raji4RH, 53.45.4% vs 23.45.51% vs. 11.30.8% (p = 0.004 and 0.006),
Karpas1106p, 46.40.3%vs 29.01.5% vs. 15.90.6% (p = 0.005 and 0.00007) and
MedB-1, 47.27.5% vs 27.78.5% vs. 12.30.5% (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0005),
respectively.Conclusion: Our preliminary data indicates that hu anti-
CD79b-vc-MMAE significantly enhances cell death and reduced cell
proliferation in sensitive/ RTX resistant CD79b+ BL and PMBL compared to
CD79b Ab or isotype control IgG1 Ab alone. Hu anti- CD79b-vc-MMAE may be
a novel agent to investigate as immunotherapeutic agent in patients with
relapsed refractory CD79b+ BL and/or PMBL.
