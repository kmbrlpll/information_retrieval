Title: WWP2 is required for normal cell cycle progression


WWP2 is a ubiquitin E3 ligase belonging to the Nedd4-like family. Given
that WWP2 target proteins including PTEN that are crucial for regulating
cell proliferation or suppressing tumorigenesis, we have asked whether
WWP2 plays a role in controlling cell cycle progression. Here we report
that WWP2 is necessary for normal cell cycle progression as its silencing
significantly reduces the cell proliferation rate. We have identified
that an isoform of WWP2 (WWP2-V4) is highly expressed in the M phase of
the cell cycle. Silencing of WWP2 accelerates the turnover of cyclin E,
which is accompanied by increased levels of phospho-histone H3 (p-H3) and
cyclin B. Moreover, silencing of WWP2 results in compromised
phosphorylation of AktS473, a residue whose phosphorylation is tightly
associated with the activation of the kinase. Combined, these results
strongly suggest that WWP2 is an important component in regulating the
Akt signaling cascade, as well as cell cycle progression.
