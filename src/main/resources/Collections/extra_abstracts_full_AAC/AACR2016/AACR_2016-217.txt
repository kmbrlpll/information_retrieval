Title: Mitochondrial reprogramming regulated cancer pathway in triple
negative breast cancer


Compared to other subtypes of tumors, triple negative breast cancers (TN
BCa) currently suffer from limited knowledge on its etiology and
treatment options. Transmitochondrial cybrids (cybrid) and multiple OMICs
approaches were used to understand mitochondrial reprogramming and
mitochondria-regulated cancer pathways in TN BCa. Analysis of cybrids and
established BCa cell lines showed that metastatic TN BCa maintain high
levels of ATP through fatty acid -oxidation and activate Src oncoprotein
by its autophosphorylation. Inhibition and induction of -oxidation
including the shRNA mediated knockdown strategies, and analysis of
patient derived xenograft (PDX) models confirmed the role of
mitochondrial -oxidation in Src activation and metastasis. Analysis of
BCa clinical data further reaffirmed the role of mitochondrial -oxidation
in Src regulation and their significance in BCa metastasis. This study is
innovative in showing the mitochondrial reprogramming mediated regulation
of a major cancer pathway by its post-translation modification.
