Title: Performance assessment of highly sensitive NGS assay for TP53


We have designed a highly sensitive assay based on the Safe-Sequencing
technology(1) to detect de novo mutations in the TP53 gene. A custom
panel was designed to cover 95% of all reported mutations in TP53. To
demonstrate assay performance, we assessed LoD, LoB, reproducibility, and
repeatability and evaluated concordance with BEAMing(2). A customized
data analysis pipeline for ultra-deep sequencing runs was developed that
includes extensive quality control and advanced mutation calling. This
highly sensitive NGS-based workflow can be applied to monitor recurrent
or minimal residual disease in cancer patients after surgery or
chemotherapy.References:(1) Kinde I, Wu J, Papadopoulos N, Kinzler KW,
