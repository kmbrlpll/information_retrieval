Title: Histone deacetylase inhibitors repress hypoxia signaling through
affecting Hsp90


Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are among the most promising
recently developed anti-cancer agents. Recent work suggests that HDACis
suppress both malignant cell metabolism and progression by interfering
with the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling, which plays a key role
in tumor progression in both actual and falsely perceived cellular
hypoxia (pseudohypoxia). However, the precise biochemical mechanism of
HDACis repression of HIFs function remains unclear. In this study, we
demonstrated that the class-2 histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA potently
inhibits hypoxia signaling via interfering with heat shock protein 90
(Hsp90). HDACis increase in the acetylation of Hsp90, resulting in less
HIF- recognition and nuclear translocation. Accumulated cytoplasmic HIF-
is not transcriptionally active and degradaded through proteosomal
pathway. Finally, we demonstrated that SAHA remarkably reduces hypoxia
signaling and decreases tumor growth in vivo. These findings provide
insight into new possible therapeutic strategies for using HDACis in
tumors with known HIF pathway aberrations.
