Title: Unbiased enrichment of circulating tumor cells directly from whole
blood


Enrichment of rare circulating tumor cells (CTC) in peripheral blood is
required prior to most analytic procedures. The ideal enrichment method
would be rapid (0.05) or pooled and compared to the pooled RosetteSep
controls (Least Squares Fit; Prob F>0.05). Over all magnet separation
conditions and samples, the mean log depletion of CD45+ cells was 2.90.4,
the mean recovery of CAMA cells was 4223%, and the residual RBC
contamination was 9000 RBC/mL of start sample. Rare cells were enriched
in 25 minutes using EasySep Direct and in less than 40 minutes using
RosetteSep with SepMate. CTC can be enriched directly from whole blood
with either EasySep Direct or RosetteSep. Since enriched cells are
unlabeled there is nothing to interfere with subsequent further
enrichment, culture, or evaluation.
