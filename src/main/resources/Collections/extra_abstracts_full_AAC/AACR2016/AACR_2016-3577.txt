Title: Pan-cancer analysis of mutagenesis by APOBEC cytidine deaminases


The elucidation of mutagenic processes that shape cancer genomes is a
fundamental problem whose solution promises insights into new treatment,
diagnostic, and prevention strategies. We and others previously
identified mutation clusters and genome-wide mutagenesis bearing the
single-strand DNA (ssDNA)-specific APOBEC cytidine deaminase signature at
5-tC-3 motifs across many cancer types. Because of high abundance of
APOBEC mutagenesis in several cancer types, we have developed a
statistical approach capable of identifying cancer samples with APOBEC
mutagenesis pattern based on WGS as well as on WES mutation data. This
analysis, called Pattern of Mutagenesis by APOBEC Cytidine Deaminases
(P-MACD), has been recently integrated into the Broad Institute GDAC
Firehose and is currently available for Firehose standard and
AWG-customized runs. The results of analysis using the P-MACD package
will be discussed, including correlations with molecular and clinical
features of TCGA cancer samples as well as relative roles of different
APOBEC enzymes in cancer mutagenesis.
