Title: A MYC-Aurka protein complex represents an actionable target in p53
altered liver cancer


Myc oncoproteins are causally involved in the genesis of a large fraction
of human tumors. Three closely related Myc proteins, c-myc, N-myc and
L-myc, have been implicated in cancer, whereas c-myc was identified as an
important oncogenic driver in frequent solid tumors.Applying
transposon-based mosaic liver cancer mouse models and direct in vivo
shRNA screening technology, we found that bypassing a latent p19Arf- and
Aurka mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest is required for development of p53
altered liver carcinomas with activated Ras/MAPK signalling. The
resulting tumors depend on high MYC levels for survival. A direct
interaction of Aurka and MYC was identified in p53 altered liver cancer
cells, which could be efficiently disrupted by conformation changing
Aurka inhibitors, resulting in MYC degradation and cell death
specifically of p53 altered human and murine hepatoma cells. Treatment
studies in mouse models of p53 deficient therapy resistant liver cancer
revealed marked therapeutic efficacy of conformation changing Aurka
inhibitors, thus suggesting a new therapeutic strategy against this major
lethal cancer.
