Title: MiR-320b-regulated TRIAP1 prevents mitochondria fragmentation and
apoptosis by controlling cytochrome c release in nasopharyngeal carcinoma


Mitochondria play critical roles in apoptosis. Imbalance of mitochondria
fusion/fission leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and initiates
intrinsic apoptosis, but the regulation of mitochondrial fragmentation in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains undefined. Here we show that
TRIAP1 is aberrantly overexpressed and associated with poor survival in
NPC patients. TRIAP1 overexpression promotes cell growth and suppresses
NPC cell death in vitro and in vivo, whereas TRIAP1 knockdown inhibits
cell tumorigenesis and enhances apoptosis through induction of
mitochondrial fragmentation, membrane potential alteration and release of
cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. In intersection with our
previous miRNA data and available bioinformatics algorithms, we
identified miR-320b as a negative regulator of TRIAP1 expression. Further
studies show that miR-320b suppresses NPC cell proliferation and enhances
mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis by targeting TRIAP1. Moreover,
loss of miRA-320b expression is conversely correlated with TRIAP1
overexpression and poor prognosis in NPC patients. This study reveals the
regulation of miR-320b/TRIAP1 in mitochondrial fragmentation and
apoptosis, and suggests potential therapeutic targets for NPC treatment.
