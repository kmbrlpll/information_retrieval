Title: Enhancement of efferocytosis by rhoA kinase inhibitor following
doxorubicin treatment synergistically reduces tumor growth


Massive dying of tumor cells after chemotherapy may promote chronic
inflammation which favors tumor growth by uncleared secondary necrotic
cells. Given that defects in apoptotic cell clearance have been linked
with various inflammatory diseases and autoimmunity, the prompt removal
of apoptotic cells by phagocytes is important for anti-tumor immunity. To
improve the anti-tumor effect of doxorubicin, we investigated the role of
RhoA-kinase (ROCK) inhibitors on efferocytosis by macrophages, which is
important for anti-tumor immunity and tissue regeneration. Treatment of
bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with ROCK inhibitor increased
efferocytosis of dying tumor cells by doxorubicin in vitro. ROCK-blockade
after doxorubicin treatment group showed effective inhibition of tumor
growth and also T cell-mediated elimination of immunogenic tumors more
than the doxorubicin monotherapy group in established tumor models.
Furthermore, we also confirmed that macrophage depletion abrogated the
therapeutic effect of ROCK inhibitor after doxorubicin treatment on tumor
growth. Taken together, our findings indicate that ROCK inhibitor
following doxorubicin treatment reduced tumor growth via efferocytosis
enhancement.
