Title: Deregulation of retinoic acid (RA) epigenetic control of
sphingolipid signaling


All-trans retinoic acid (RA), the bioactive derivative of vitamin A, can
paradoxically exert both anti-cancer and cancer-promoting actions.
According to our studies, RA promotes breast cancer cell growth and
invasion whenever it fails to exert its genome-wide epigenetic control of
transcription via the RA receptor alpha (RARA). Factors that negatively
affect RARA genomic function lead to genome-wide deregulation of the
transcriptome epigenetically regulated by RA, including RARA-target genes
controlling critical sphingolipid functions. We show here that functional
inhibition of genomic RARA concomitantly leads to epigenetic repression
of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2/SMDP3), a critical enzyme involved
in the synthesis of pro-apoptotic ceramide, and upregulation of S1PR1, a
key receptor of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a sphingolipid with
pro-proliferative and pro-invasive activity. Selective activation of
S1PR1 recapitulates RA pro-proliferative/pro-invasive action, while
selective inhibition of S1PR1 counteracts it. Apparently, activation of
the S1P-S1PR1 axis, combined with lack of RARA-mediated epigenetic
control of SMPD3-ceramide axis, contributes to determine RA tumorigenic
action.This study was supported by the NCI R01 CA127614 grant (NS).
