Title: GITRL-Fc can significantly reduce tumor growth by stimulating
innate and adaptive immunity


Although the interaction between GITR (Glucocorticoid-Induced Tumor
Necrosis Factor Receptor) and GITRL (its ligand) is important for the
development of immune responses, the cellular mechanisms underlying
anti-tumor immunity including both innate and adaptive immunity is not
fully understood. We generated a novel single-gene linkerless GITRL
trimer fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (GITRL-Fc), and investigated
its effect on controlling tumor growth and immune responses in
preclinical tumor models. Treatment with GITRL-Fc significantly reduced
tumor growth in several preclinical tumor models by inducing Th1 biased
anti-tumor immunity and reducing Treg-mediated immune suppression. Immune
cell depletion studies showed that anti-tumor immunity induced by
GITRL-Fc depended on CD8+ T cells as well as NK cells. Furthermore, the
combination of GITRL-Fc with PD-1 blockade significantly reduced the
tumor growth in the Renca murine kidney adenocarcinoma tumor model. Taken
together, these results suggest that GITRL-Fc can improve cancer
treatment as a single agent or in combination therapy by enhancing innate
and adaptive cellular immunity.
