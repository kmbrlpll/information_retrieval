Title: Glioma cells display a prognostically significant hematopoietic
phenotype


Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive human
cancers. Glioma cells expressed immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
motif (ITAM) bearing molecules, such as Fc receptors, T cell receptor
components and C-type lectins and expression was up regulated in two
distinct tumor-derived prognostic signatures identified in GBM and
low-grade gliomas. Targeting SYK, downstream of ITAM molecules,
attenuated GBM tumor growth and invasiveness, and reduced B and CD11b+
cell mobility and infiltration resulting in improved survival. In
addition, GBM tumor cells were found to display phagocytic
characteristics in vitro and in vivo by flow cytometry and two photon
imaging. Our data demonstrate that gliomas are hematopoietic-like tumors
that express an immune signaling network important in glioma progression,
and identify targets for therapeutic intervention.
