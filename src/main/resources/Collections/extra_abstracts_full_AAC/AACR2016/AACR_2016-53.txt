Title: Epigenetic silencing of krebs cycle metabolism in kidney cancer


Mounting evidence points to alterations in mitochondrial metabolism in
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) including recent large-scale transcriptomic
data demonstrating loss of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme
expression with aggressive tumors. Using a metabolomics/transcriptomics
approach, we identified loss of mRNA expression of PGC-1 and ERR- is
associated with tumor progression and worsened outcomes in RCC patients.
PGC-1 both induces and cooperates with ERR- to promote TCA cycle enzyme
expression. Additionally, PGC-1 reconstitution in RCC cells reverses the
glycolytic phenotype and suppresses invasive phenotypes. Loss of PGC-1
and ERR- is through DNA and histone repressive silencing of the
transcription factor PRDM16. Loss of PRDM16 is among the most prominent
transcriptional changes in metastatic tumor sites. PRDM16 expression in
RCC cells restorers TCA cycle enzyme expression, mitigates the Warburg
phenotype, and suppresses in vivo tumorigenesis. Collectively, our data
uncover a transcription factor network epigenetically silenced in renal
cancer resulting in suppression of mitochondrial metabolism.
