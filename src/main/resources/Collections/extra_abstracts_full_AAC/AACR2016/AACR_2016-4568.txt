Title: 14-3-3z-mediated oncogenic signaling downstream of HER2 in breast
cancer


The goal of this study is to identify mechanisms by which the oncogenic
tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 promotes the growth and metastasis of
breast cancer. Previously published work suggests that the
phospho-binding protein 14-3-3, which is highly expressed in a variety of
breast cancer subtypes, promotes HER2-mediated oncogenic signaling. In
this study, we hypothesized that 14-3-3 sustains HER2 signaling by
binding to and modulating a network of proteins that are phosphorylated
downstream of HER2 activation. Using proteomics as a tool to identify
14-3-3 interacting proteins in HER2+ breast cancer cells treated with or
without Lapatinib (HER2 inhibitor), we identified a subset HER2-dependent
14-3-3 interacting proteins. We have focused our current effort on one of
these proteins, SH3BP4, which plays a critical role in controlling mTOR
activation. We have identified a nutrient-sensitive phosphorylation
within a putative 14-3-3 binding site on SH3BP4 and we are currently
working to understand its mechanism of regulation and impact on
mTOR-mediated growth signaling downstream of HER2.
