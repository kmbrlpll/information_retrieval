Title: Generation and molecular profiling of drug-resistant cancer cell
lines


Drug resistance is the main cause of ineffective chemotherapy in
patients. Many cancers respond initially well to therapy but eventually
the cancer recurs as drug-resistant disease leading to the patient death.
Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular basis of the drug
resistance is warranted in order to elucidate the mechanisms and markers
underlying this drug-resistant phenotype In this study, we aimed to
generate and characterize a panel of drug resistant cancer cell lines,
providing a valuable tool with which to investigate the molecular
pathways and putative markers that may be associated with this resistance
phenotype in cancer.
