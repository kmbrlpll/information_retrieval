Title: Development and validation of a novel EGF receptor-neutralizing
monoclonal antibody


The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell-surface receptor
for members of the epidermal growth factor family (EGF-family). EGFR
dimerizes upon ligand binding, which leads to autophosphorylation,
downstream signaling and ultimately internalization. In cancer, EGFR
mutations and amplification have been linked to cell proliferation and
survival. Two EGFR neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are currently FDA
approved, which includes Cetuximab (Erbitux, BMS; mouse/human chimeric)
and Panitumumab (ABX-EGF, Amgen; fully humanized). However, these
antibodies are often unavailable to researchers studying this important
pathway. Here we describe the development and validation of a new rabbit
monoclonal EGFR neutralizing antibody (clone D1D4J). D1D4J was validated
using cell-based models and immunofluorescence imaging. D1D4J binds EGFR
and neutralizes EGF-induced activation and internalization. Compared to
other Research Use Only (RUO) neutralizing antibodies on the market,
D1D4J shows superior performance and is a useful research tool in the
EGFR signaling space.
