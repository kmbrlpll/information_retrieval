Title: Uncover novel drug combinations for triple negative breast cancer


Therapeutic options for triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are limited
to multiple lines of chemotherapy with no FDA-approved targeted
therapies. In the absence of a clear driver oncogene, the most common
molecular alterations, including EGF receptor and genes involved in cell
cycle, DNA repair and the PI3K pathway, may represent new therapeutic
opportunities in TNBC. Indeed clinical benefits from PARP, EGFR and PI3K
inhibitors have been reported in some TNBC patient. However, none of
these studies have demonstrated durable responses, indicating that
inhibition of additional pathways might be necessary to successfully
improve the clinical efficacy of targeted therapies in TNBC. To develop
novel, combinatorial therapeutic approaches for TNBC we performed a
pharmacological screen testing 672 unique drug combinations in multiple
TNBC models. The screen identified previously known and efficacious
synergies, such as between EGFR and PI3K inhibitors, supporting the
validity of our data and analysis. Importantly, we also identified novel
promising drug combinations that we are currently exploring.
