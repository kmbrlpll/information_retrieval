Title: Understanding the role of microRNA-206 in breast cancer


MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNA sequences that that can modify genes
in post transcriptional manner and are often de-regulated in cancer.
Cancer stem cells, a subset of cancer cells with stem cell properties,
are considered the root of tumorigenesis and seeds of metastasis. In this
study we are interested in elucidating the role of miR-206 in breast
cancer stem cell-mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis. We have observed
that microRNA-206 (miR-206) regulate the metastatic traits of breast
cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Our studies have elucidated a
signaling cascade that culminates in the silencing of cytokine (such as
interleukin) and integrin expression. Knockdown of the interleukin and
integrin genes by siRNAs mimics the phenotype of miR-206 expression in
breast cancer cells. DNA content analysis using propidium iodide staining
revealed that knockdown of miR-206 targets as well as over-expression of
miR-206 in MDA-MB-231 cells regulates cell cycle arrest. Our results
indicate that miR-206 mediates its regulatory effects through inhibiting
multiple targets. MiR-206 may serve as a new therapeutic candidate for
the future treatment of breast cancer.
