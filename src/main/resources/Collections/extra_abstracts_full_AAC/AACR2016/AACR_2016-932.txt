Title: AR signaling differentially regulates the growth of prostate
epithelial cells


The prostate is an androgen-dependent organ. Androgen stimulates the
growth of normal prostatic cells, as well as prostate cancer (PCa).
However, AR signaling does not always promote cell proliferation, in some
cases, it may even inhibit the growth of prostatic cells. In this study,
we used NHPrE, a cell line derived from normal human prostate epithelia,
to study how AR signaling modulates the growth of prostatic cells and to
explore the mechanisms involved in AR's differential function in vitro
and in vivo. Our results showed that inducing AR signaling in NHPrE cells
suppressed their growth in vitro, concomitant with a reduction of Myc. In
contrast, ectopic expression of AR in NHPrE cells induced the expression
of Myc and pSTAT3 and drove the development of invasive PCa in vivo,
suggesting a distinct in vivo function of AR signaling in prostatic
cells. Furthermore, our data showed that the presence of prostate stromal
cells over-rode androgen-mediated growth inhibition on NHPrE/AR cells in
vitro; and IL-6/pSTAT3 was implicated in this stromal/epithelial
communication. In conclusion, our study showed that AR signaling
differentially regulated the growth of prostatic cells in vitro and in
vivo through a mechanism that involved stromal/epithelial interactions.
