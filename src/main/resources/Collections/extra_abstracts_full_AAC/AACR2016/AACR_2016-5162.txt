Title: Id1 is an oncogenic target of RNA binding protein HuR in gastric
cancer


Hu antigen R (HuR), a ubiquitous RNA-binding protein (RBP), has been
shown to be overexpressed in gastric cancer. Cytoplasmic HuR is reported
to be associated with high stage, distant metastases and unresectability.
HuR efficiently regulates cancer-related gene expression by binding to
AU- and U-rich sequences (ARE) in the 3 and 5-untranslated region (UTR)
of mRNAs. Id1 (Inhibitor of DNA binding) is a putative oncogene that we
previously found was upregulated in gastric cancer and associated with
poor prognosis. Id1 mRNA contains several putative HuR ARE sites. Our
goal is to determine the impact of HuR on Id1 expression. We first
confirmed Id1 is a HuR target by Ribonucleoprotein Immunoprecipitation
(RNP-IP) in gastric cancer cells. Then, we found KH-3, a potent and
specific inhibitor of HuR, inhibited Id1 mRNA and protein expression. The
proliferative and invasive capabilities of the gastric cancer cells were
also inhibited by KH-3. We conclude that Id1 is a target of RNA-binding
protein HuR in gastric cancer. HuR specific inhibitor, KH-3, may be a
promising therapeutic agent in treating HuR/Id1 high gastric cancers.
