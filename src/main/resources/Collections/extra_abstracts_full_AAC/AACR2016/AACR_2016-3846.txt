Title: Sensitivity of NOTCH1 mutant T-ALL to ABT-263


Effective targeted therapies are lacking for refractory and relapsed
T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). Analysis of a large cell
line screen revealed that NOTCH1 mutant T-ALL cells are sensitive to the
Bcl-2/xL inhibitor ABT-263. We show that NOTCH1 inhibits the mTOR complex
1, resulting in low MCL-1 levels and sensitization to ABT-263. Further
suppression of mTORC1 using small molecule inhibitors in combination with
ABT-263 results in very high levels of apoptosis and tumor regressions in
vivo. This suggests new therapeutic opportunities for NOTCH1 mutant
T-ALL, including in the setting of gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI)
resistance.
