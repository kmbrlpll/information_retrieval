Title: Epithelial-mesenchymal-epithelial transition induced by long term
exposure to TGFB1 creates cellular heterogeneity


Reversible and dynamic transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal
cellular states (EMT/MET) contribute to cancer progression and
dissemination. Whereas EMT facilitates initial steps of tumour cell
detachment, MET is likely required for colonization at distant sites.
Although MET is generally perceived as mirroring EMT, we hypothesize that
MET entails its own set of novel and/or differentially active molecular
circuitries, generating cells with features distinct from the original
epithelial state.Using an in vitro TGF1-induced EMT/MET model, we
demonstrated that MET generates co-existing heterogeneous cell
populations (Reverted-Epithelial or RE-cells) with novel phenotypic and
functional properties, such as increased self-renewal, in vivo increased
tumourigenicity and distinct chemoresistance properties.Overall, our
results indicate that MET is a permissive process, driving cellular
plasticity towards heterogeneity and with it, creating novel biological
signatures of relevance for cancer growth.
