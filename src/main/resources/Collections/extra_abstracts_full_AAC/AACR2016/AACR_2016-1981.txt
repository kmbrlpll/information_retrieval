Title: Histone demethyalase JMJD1A promotes the DNA damage response of
prostate cancer cells


DNA damage is a common feature of prostate cancer (PCa) therapies (e.g.
radio-, chemo- and androgen deprivation therapies). Thus, the DNA damage
response (DDR) is a key factor in determining the therapeutic response of
PCa patients. JMJD1A regulates gene expression by demethylating H3K9.
Here, we identified a new role for JMJD1A in the DDR of PCa cells.
Inhibition of JMJD1A led to increased r-H2AX foci (marker for the double
strand DNA breaks) in the non-irradiated cells, and the delayed clearance
of r-H2AX foci in the irradiated cells. JMJD1A knockdown in PCa cells
inhibited the DNA strand break repair in the reporter assays. We further
found that phosphorylation and ubiquitination were key modifications that
regulate the activity of JMJD1A in the DDR. Ectopic expression of the
mutant JMJD1A at the phosphorylation or ubiquitination site attenuated
the expression of DNA repair factors, DNA strand break repair, and PCa
cell proliferation under irradiation and androgen deprivation conditions.
Our results suggest that targeting JMJD1A may sensitize the response of
PCa to the major anti-PCa therapies.
