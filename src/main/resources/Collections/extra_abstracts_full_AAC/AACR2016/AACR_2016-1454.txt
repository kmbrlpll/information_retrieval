Title: IL-4 modulate the tumor microenvironment and response to cancer
therapies


recent findings show that immune cells constitute a large fraction of the
tumor microenvironment and modulate tumor progression. Clinical data
indicate that chronic inflammation is present at tumor sites and that
IL-4 in particular is up-regulated. Thus, we tested whether depletion of
IL-4 affected in tumor immunity. Current results demonstrate that
administration of neutralizing antibody against IL-4 enhances anti-tumor
immunity and improve the response to Taxol-based chemotherapy and CpG ODN
immunotherapy. Depletion of IL-4 also alter the tumor microenvironment,
reducing the generation of immunosuppressive M2 macrophages and myeloid
derived suppressor cells and enhancing tumor specific CTLs. These
findings suggest that IL-4 impact anti-tumor immunity and constitute an
attractive therapeutic target to reduce immune suppression in the tumor
microenvironment and thus enhance the efficacy of cancer therapy.
