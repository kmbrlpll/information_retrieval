Title: Up-regulated miR-96-5p inhibits apoptosis by targeting FOXO1 in
hepatocellular carcinoma


Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers and the
third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, especially in Asia and
sub-Saharan Africa. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that
regulate gene expression and can act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes.
To identify miRNA involved in HCC, we performed a genome-wide miRNA gene
expression analysis using the human miRNA microarray (Agilent) in paired
tumor and non-tumor tissues from patients with primary HCC. The
array-based miRNA expression profiles were validated by quantitative PCR.
We identified miR-96-5p as the most significantly upregulated miRNA in
HCC tumors. Although miR-96-5p has been recognized as an oncogenic miRNA,
its role in the pathogenesis of HCC remains unknown. Our study showed
that the inhibition of miR-96-5p reduced proliferation of HCC cells and
induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that the forkhead box O1 (FOXO1)
gene was a target of miR-96-5p. FOXO1, a transcription factor, plays an
essential role in cell fate decisions. FOXO1 can induce apoptosis through
mitochondria-dependent and mitochondria-independent pathways.
Collectively, our results suggested that miR-96-5p may function as an
oncogenic miRNA through inhibiting apoptosis by targeting FOXO1 in HCC.
