Title: The functional involvement of H19, a Long noncoding RNA, in human
colorectal cancer


The clinical significance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), defined as
transcripts longer than 200 bp that do not code for proteins, in
colorectal cancer (CRC) remains largely uncharacterized. We selected 10
lncRNAs associated with CRC, analyzed their expression association with
patient survival using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) CRC data, and
identified H19 as the one significantly associated with CRC patient
survival. Experimental data using CRC cell line models showed that
downregulation of H19 significantly reduced cancer cell proliferation,
anchorage-independent growth, and cell migration capacity. Flow
cytometric analysis suggested a clear G1 arrest of CRC cells following
depletion of H19 expression. Our mechanism study suggests that H19 is
pivotal in maintaining Wnt signaling and notch signaling. These finding
represent a novel mechanism of H19 function in colorectal cancer, and
strongly support the translational importance of this lncRNA as cancer
marker and therapeutic target.
