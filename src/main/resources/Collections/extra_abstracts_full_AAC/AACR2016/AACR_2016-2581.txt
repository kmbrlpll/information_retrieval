Title: Determinants for compliance to colorectal cancer screening in
Korea: A multilevel analysis


BACKGROUND: This study aimed at investigating the individual and area
level factors associated with colorectal cancer screening
attendance.METHODS: Colorectal cancer screening participation as well as
other individual level data were gathered from the fifth Korea National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2010-2012. The area level data
were extracted from 2009 Health promotion strategies and programs
development for health inequalities alleviation (Shin et al.,2009).
Multilevel model was used for data analysis.RESULTS: Information on a
total of 8,783 individuals (3,777 men and 5,006 women) aged 50 years and
older and deprivation index of each areas were used in the final
analysis. Among individual level variables, men were more likely to
participated in colorectal cancer screening within 5 years than women
(58.0% for men vs 53.9% for women)(Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.85; 95% CI 0.73 to
0.99), and highest among age 60-69 (63.3%). Area level variables's
explained class-level variance was 6.4%.CONCLUSION: In this study, by
applying the multilevel analysis we can find that colorectal cancer
screening attendance rate is associated with both individual and
community factors.
