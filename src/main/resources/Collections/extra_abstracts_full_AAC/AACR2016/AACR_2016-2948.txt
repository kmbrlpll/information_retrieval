Title: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mediates drug resistance in
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma


A leading cause of mortality in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients is
the development of resistance to the CHOP chemotherapy regimen. We have
discovered that CHOP-resistant DLBCL cells express higher G6PDH
activities and lower reactive oxygen (predominantly superoxide) levels
than CHOP-sensitive cells. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) is
the rate-limiting enzyme of the NADPH-producing pentose phosphate shunt
(PPP). The PPP is the most important pathway for recycling of cellular
glutathione (GSH), a key scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In
the PPP oxidative phase, glucose 6-phosphate is irreversibly converted
into ribulose 5-phosphate and CO2 leading to the synthesis of NADPH, a
redox cofactor for many antioxidant enzymes. The NADPH produced is used
by glutathione reductase to reduce GSSG (glutathione disulfide) to GSH.
We hypothesized that increased activity of the G6PDH pathway leads to
higher GSH production, lower oxidative state (ROS), and CHOP-resistance.
In support of our hypothesis, downregulation of G6PDH lowered NADPH and
GSH levels, increased ROS, and reversed CHOP-resistance in DLBCL cells.
These results indicate an important role for the G6DPH pathway in
mediating CHOP resistance in DLBCL.
