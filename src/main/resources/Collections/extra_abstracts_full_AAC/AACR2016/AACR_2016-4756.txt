Title: N-cadherin signaling predicts prognosis in medulloblastoma subtypes


Identification of signaling pathways that drive the clinical behavior of
tumors will guide specific molecular therapies. Medulloblastoma, the most
common malignant pediatric solid tumor, shows considerable clinical and
molecular diversity, providing impetus for specific targeted therapies of
predicted molecular drivers. Here we show a gene signature derived from
in vitro experimental inhibition of N-cadherin in medulloblastoma (MB)
cells predicts survival in human MB in two large independent patient
cohorts. Patients with high N-cadherin signature scores had earlier death
and reduced overall survival. We found novel heterogeneity in proposed MB
molecular subgroups, with significant differences in survival predicted
by the N-cadherin signature in sonic hedgehog (SHH) and c2 tumors. In
cultured MB cells, N-cadherin cell-cell interactions activated
beta-catenin signaling and increased expression of the cancer stem cell
regulator Sox2, known to be critical in the growth and relapse of SHH MB.
Inhibition of N-cadherin reduced beta-catenin signaling and Sox2.
Together, these findings indicate N-cadherin activity predicts the
survival of patients with MB and suggest that differential activity of
cellular pathways can identify novel disease subgroups and reveal
molecular mechanisms with therapeutic significance.
