Title: U3-1784, a human anti-FGFR4 antibody for the treatment of cancer


Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 (FGFR4) is the fourth member of the
Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) family of receptor tyrosine
kinases. All of the FGFR's have been implicated in cancer development due
to increased activation of their enzymatic activity either by gene
mutation, over-expression or inadvertent ligand-mediated stimulation. One
important alteration that may lead to FGFR4 activation in cancer is the
overexpression of its ligand FGF19 in 20-40% of primary liver
cancer.Here, we report the development of U3-1784, a phage
display-derived fully human antibody that specifically binds to FGFR4 but
not to isoforms of FGFR1-3. The antibody binds to an epitope in the
putative ligand binding domain of the receptor and consequently inhibits
ligand binding and downstream signaling. In a panel of 10 tumor models
derived from hepatocellular carcinoma, U3-1784 significantly inhibits the
growth of FGF19-expressing models up to 90% whereas models without FGF19
expression are insensitive. These results strongly suggest that the
FGFR4/FGF19 axis is an oncogenic driver in hepatocellular carcinoma.
U3-1784 is currently in phase I clinical trials.
