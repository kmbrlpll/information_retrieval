Title: Genomic analyses reveal two distinct biologic entities of
endometrial endometrioid carcinoma


Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is classified into two types: type 1
(endometrioid type) and type 2 (non-endometrioid type). Type 1
endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EA) has been generally considered a single
disease entity and was developed from endometrial hyperplasia as a
precursor lesion. Recently we identified two distinct subgroups in type 1
EA; groups 1 and 2 as tumors with and without endometrial hyperplasia,
respectively. The purpose of this study is to identify genes involved
those differentially expressed by groups 1 and 2 EA. Genomic analyses
including transcriptome and exome sequencing and immunohistochemistry
were performed. For the validation, these data were projected to the TCGA
(The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network) data. In the results of
transcriptome, group 1 and 2 EAs identified differential regulation of
multiple genes and pathways. As an example, estrogen receptor (ER)
related pathways were up-regulated in group 1 EA. Immunohistochemical
analyses further confirmed overexpression of ER and PgR in the protein
level. In the result of exome sequencing, mutation was observed more
frequently in group 2 and sixteen driver genes were more frequently
mutated in group 2.
