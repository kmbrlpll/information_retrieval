Title: Long term cell culture models to identify biomarkers of response


In order to test the efficacy of many cancer therapeutics, culturing
cells in the presence of compounds for longer than the conventional 72-hr
cell growth assay may be necessary. It is shown that the inhibition of
many epigenetic targets results in a significantly delayed drug response
not revealed by conventional shorter term cell growth assays. OncoPanel
from Eurofins Pharma Discovery Services is a collection of 300 cell lines
with broad cancer type and subtype representation and extensive genomic
characterization. We have developed a 10-day assay to test inhibitors of
epigenetic targets. Using the EZH2-selective inhibitor, GSK343, we have
demonstrated the advantages of cell line profiling under long-term assay
conditions when drug response reflects a protracted mechanism of action.
We also tested Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, in this system and showed
substancial increased sensitivity against several cell lines versus the
72 hr assay. The significant biomarkers identified from the genomic
analysis of the data from both GSK343 and Olaparib substantiate the
relevance of long term cell profiling.
