Title: Polo-like kinase 1 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
and promotes epithelial cell motility by activating CRAF/ERK signaling


Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a key cell cycle regulator that has been
implicated in the development of various cancers, including prostate
cancer. However, the functions of PLK1 beyond cell cycle regulation
remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that PLK1 overexpression in
prostate epithelial cells triggers oncogenic transformation. It also
results in dramatic transcriptional reprogramming of the cells, leading
to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stimulation of cell
migration and invasion. Consistently, PLK1 downregulation in metastatic
prostate cancer cells enhances epithelial characteristics and inhibits
cell motility. The signaling mechanisms underlying the observed cellular
effects of PLK1 involve direct PLK1-dependent regulation of CRAF with
subsequent stimulation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Fra1-ZEB1/2 signaling
pathway. Our findings highlight novel non-canonical functions of PLK1 as
a key regulator of EMT and cell motility in normal prostate epithelium
and prostate cancer. This study also uncovers a previously unanticipated
role of PLK1 as a potent activator of MAPK signaling.
