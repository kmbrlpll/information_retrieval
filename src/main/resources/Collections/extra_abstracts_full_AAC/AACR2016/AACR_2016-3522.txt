Title: Cyclins and CDKs regulation and caspase cascade activation by
cucurbitacin D induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in pancreatic tumor


Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis and very low survival rate over
the world. Because pancreatic cancer probably is diagnosed at a late
stage, aggressive local invasion, and poor response to chemotherapy.
Gemcitabine was the standard treatment for advanced and metastatic
pancreatic cancer patients, but it is associated with multiple adverse
effects-fever, fatigue, nausea, and drug resistance. Whether cucurbitacin
D has any efficacy against human pancreatic cancer was examined in cell
culture system. In vitro, cell viability was measured by MTT assay to
recognize of cell cytotoxicity. Consequently, cytotoxicity was observed
at a low concentration of cucurbitacin D. Wound healing assay and
clonogenic assay indicated that cucurubitacin D inhibited the growth of
cell growth through cyclins and CDKs regulation, and decreased
colony-forming ability. Also, this compound down-regulated expression
level of anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, up-regulated of pro-apoptotic
molecule Bax, and activated caspase-8, caspase-3 cascade extrinsic
pathway. Additionally, PARP, caspase-3 substrate, protein was cleaved by
cucurbitacin D treatment. Overall, our study suggest that cucurbitacin D
could be a clinical medicine for the treatment of pancreatic cancers.
