Title: ER sensitizes NSCLC cells to chemotherapeutic agents by regulating
DNA damage response


The expression of wild-type estrogen receptor (ER1) correlates with
increased survival in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
However, the molecular mechanism that accounts for this association is
unknown. ER1 was previously shown to sensitize breast cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic agents. The role of the receptor in regulating
sensitivity of NSCLC cells to chemotherapy, a common treatment option for
advanced disease, has not been studied. Here we show that upregulation of
ER1 decreases the survival of NSCLC cells in response to treatment with
doxorubicin. This effect was observed in p53-defective but not wild-type
p53-expressing cells. ER1 enhanced G2/M cell cycle arrest in NSCLC cells
by activating the checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and altering downstream
signaling. The expression of the p63 target gene cyclin G2 that regulates
the G2/M checkpoint was induced by ER1 proposing an ER1-p63
transcriptional cooperation. Our findings suggest the involvement of ER1
in the regulation of DNA damage response in NSCLC cells and support the
potential predictive value of the receptor in clinical management of the
disease.
