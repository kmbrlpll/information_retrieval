Title: Restoration of wildtype structure and function of mutant p53 by
thiosemicarbozones using a novel zinc metallochaperone based mechanism


NSC319726 (ZMC1) is a small molecule that reactivates mutant p53 by
restoration of WT structure and function to the most common p53 missense
mutant (p53-R175H). We identified that ZMC1 functions as a
zinc-metallochaperone, providing an optimal concentration of zinc to
facilitate proper folding of p53 protein, and increasing cellular
reactive oxygen species to transactivate the newly conformed p53-R175H
(via post-translational modifications). ZMC1 was identified from an in
silico screen of the NCI anti-cancer drug screen along with two other
thiosemicarbazones (TSCs), NSC319725 and NSC328784. We investigated these
TSCs to determine if they could reactivate mutant p53 using a zinc
metallochaperone mechanism. We found that indeed these compounds could
reactivate mutant p53 by functioning as zinc metallochaperones. In
distinction, Triapine the only TSC in clinical development, does not
function as a zinc metallochaperone and is not a mutant p53 reactivator.
