Title: Gingerol aspirinate derivatives as novel chemopreventive agents
for colon cancer


Regular aspirin use has been convincingly shown to reduce the risk of
colorectal cancer. However, long-term use of aspirin leads to
gastrotoxicity. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel class of
gingerol- and shogaol-based aspirin prodrugs to simultaneously release
aspirin and gingerol or shogaol to attenuate the side effects caused by
aspirin. Prodrug GAS exerted enhanced anticancer activities, which are
better than a physical mixture of aspirin and 6-gingerol as well as each
individual. In addition, GAS eliminated the gastric toxicity induced by
aspirin in mice. Metabolism of GAS in mice showed that the majority of
GAS is decomposed to release 6-gingerol and aspirin or salicylic acid
either in the intestine or after absorption. Mechanistic studies
demonstrate GAS could dose-dependently inhibit COX pathway. These
findings highlighted the improved anticancer properties of gingerol-based
aspirin prodrugs. GAS may represent novel and safe alternatives of
aspirin for the purpose of daily use in the future.
