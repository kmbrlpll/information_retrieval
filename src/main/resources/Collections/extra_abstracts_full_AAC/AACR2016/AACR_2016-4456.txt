Title: Preliminary investigation of the promoter methylation status of
BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53 genes of some breast cancer patients


Epigenetic alterations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53, such as DNA methylation,
may be an effective approach in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy in
breast cancer. This study examines the DNA methylation signature of
BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 in some breast cancer patients attending a Clinic
in Lagos, Nigeria. In this study, 14 blood specimens with Invasive Ductal
Carcinoma (IDC) were investigated. The samples were modified by Bisulfite
modification, and then assessed by Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP). The
methylation analysis indicates that 7(50%) of the 14 patients had a
segment of the promoter region of BRCA1 gene methylated, 8 (57.14%) of
BRCA2 methylated and 11(78.57%) of TP53 promoter region. This study
provides preliminary evidence for the gene expression inactivation of
BRCA 1, BRCA 2, and TP53 Genes in over 50% of the 14 patients with Stage
2 invasive ductal carcinoma who participated in this study.
