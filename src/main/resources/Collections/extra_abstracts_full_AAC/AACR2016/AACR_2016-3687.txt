Title: p53 downregulates CRKL oncogene through miR-200


Tumor suppressive miRNAs targeting oncogenes are frequently downregulated
in cancers, which leads to the activation of the oncogene pathways. Thus,
tumor suppressive miRNAs as well as their target oncogenes are proposed
to be useful for cancer treatment. The downregulation of the miR-200
family has been involved in the progression and metastasis in cancers.
The miR-200 family consists of two gene clusters: miR-200b/200a/429 and
miR-200c/141 are located on human chromosome 1 and 12, respectively.
Here, we identified that p53 response elements are located around both
clusters of miR-200s and confirmed miR-200s as transcriptional targets of
p53. in silico analysis of miRNA target predicted an oncogene CRKL as a
potential target for miR-200b/200c/429. Moreover, miR-200b/200c/429
inhibit the expression of CRKL mRNA and protein by directly targeting its
3-UTR region. Importantly, endogenous CRKL expression was decreased in
cancer cells with introduction of wild-type p53. Moreover, downregulation
of CRKL by siRNA in cancer cells inhibits cell growth. Oncomine database
shows that CRKL levels are overexpressed in a subset of cancer types.
Furthermore, CRKL is significantly overexpressed in primary breast cancer
tissues harboring mutant TP53. Our results demonstrate that p53-target
miRNAs, miR-200b/200c/429 are negative regulators of the CRKL oncogene.
