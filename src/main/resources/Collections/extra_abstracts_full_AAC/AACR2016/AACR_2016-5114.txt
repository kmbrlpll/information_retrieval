Title: The role of microvesicles on immune function in response to cancer


Cell to cell communication is vital for the co-ordination of
physiological process and the regulation of an organism's phenotype. More
recently communication via extracellular membrane vesicles has gained
recognition. We first described a novel mechanism for the spread and
dominance of multidrug resistance (MDR) and enhanced metastatic capacity
in cancer via submicron microparticles (MPs). MPs are plasma membrane
vesicles released spontaneously from various cell types, carrying
bioactive material and are implicated in different physiological and
pathophysiological processes. Through this communication apparatus,
cancer cells can acquire and secure a survival advantage by various
mechanisms. This study aims to examine a role of MPs in altering immune
cell function in cancer.The effects of MPs isolated from human breast
cancer cells were examined on antigen presenting cells (APC) in vitro.
MP-mediated effects on cell phenotype and functionality was assessed by
cytokine profiling and migration assay. We observed a cancer cell induced
change in immune cell phenotype and functionality which have the
potential to support a reduced global immune response in cancer. The
elucidation of this pathway provides novel therapeutic strategies which
can be exploited for the treatment of cancer.
