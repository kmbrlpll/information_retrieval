Title: TRIM8 modulates stem-like cells in glioblastoma


Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSC) contribute to rapid growth and
clinical recurrence of these fatal tumors and are highly resistant to
therapy. STAT3 is known to contribute to maintenance and proliferation of
GSC. Here we report a novel protein known as Tri-partite Motif containing
protein 8 (TRIM8) that modifies tumor growth through STAT3. TRIM8,
previously referred to as glioblastoma expressed ring finger protein is
expressed at equal levels in glioblastoma and normal brain samples,
despite showing hemizygous deletion in 87% of cases in TCGA data. To
uncover mechanisms, we knocked down TRIM8 in glioblastoma-derived
neurospheres using sh-RNA and found that this reduced the levels of
phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), C-MYC and SOX2. Overexpression of TRIM8
resulted in higher expression of p-STAT3, C-MYC, SOX2 and CD133. We also
found that specifically blocking STAT3 in neurospheres by pharmacological
inhibition reduced the expression of TRIM8. Conversely, upregulation of
STAT3 induced by IL-6 results in increased expression of TRIM8. Together,
our results indicate that TRIM8 could potentially regulate GSC by forming
a positive feedback loop with STAT3.
