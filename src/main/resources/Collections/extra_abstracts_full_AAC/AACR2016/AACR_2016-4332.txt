Title: Discovery of BAY 1163877 - A pan-FGFR inhibitor: De novo
structure-based design and lead optimization of
benzothiophenyl-pyrrolotriazines


Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) orchestrate a variety of cellular
functions by binding to their transmembrane tyrosine-kinase receptors
(FGFR1-4) and activating downstream signaling pathways. Alterations in
FGFR encoding genes are frequently observed in a variety of solid tumors
including lung, gastric, breast and urothelial cancer. Therefore,
targeting FGFRs using selective FGFR inhibitors is an attractive
therapeutic approach to treat cancer patients.BAY 1163877 is an orally
active, highly potent and selective small molecule FGFR-1, -2 and -3
kinase inhibitor. We disclose for the very first time its discovery and
chemical structure. BAY 1163877 was derived from a de novo
structure-based design approach and medicinal chemistry optimization.
Data on the structure activity relationship and the pharmacokinetic
profile of the benzothiophenyl-pyrrolotriazine structure class will be
presented. Based on its favorable preclinical profile, BAY 1163877 is
currently being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT01976741).
