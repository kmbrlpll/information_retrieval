Title: Combined BET-bromodomain and CDK2 inhibition in MYC-driven
medulloblastoma


Misexpression of MYC genes (MYC and MYCN) occurs commonly in
medulloblastoma (MB), the most frequent malignant childhood brain tumor.
We previously showed that tumors are addicted to MYCN and that MYCN
stabilization is required for MB development in mice (Swartling et al,
Genes & Dev, 2010; Cancer Cell, 2012). Targeted MYCN suppression
completely depleted MYCN-driven MB cells in vivo. Immediate
transcriptional changes from such MYCN blockade were found by RNA-Seq and
showed similarities to changes that occurred after CDK2 suppression or
when inhibiting BET bromodomains. CDK2 and BET inhibitors both inhibited
MYC protein expression and effectively induced cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis. Compared with either agent alone a sustained combination
treatment over 7-10 days displayed synergy and effectively abolished
tumor cell proliferation in vitro. The combined treatment further reduced
tumor growth in orthotopical MB transplants and significantly prolonged
survival as compared to single agent therapy. Our data suggest that dual
inhibition of CDK2 and BET Bromodomains could be a novel treatment
approach in suppressing medulloblastoma by targeting MYC proteins.
