Title: Pharmacodynamic biomarker studies of TRC105 anti-endoglin (CD105)
antibody revealed anti-angiogenic activity associated with CD105 depletion


Introduction: CD105 is involved in normal vascular development. It is
over expressed on the surface of proliferating vascular endothelial cells
and is implicated in tumor angiogenesis. In hypoxic conditions, CD105 is
upregulated through induction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-. TRC105 is a
chimeric IgG1 antibody specific for CD105 and the agent for this phase I
trial.Methods: 20 patients with metastatic prostate cancer were treated
with TRC105 at six dose levels in a phase I trial. Blood samples were
analyzed for CD105 antigen depletion, VEGF as a marker for systemic
hypoxia, and PSA.Results: Maximum tolerated dose of 20 mg/kg every two
weeks was reached. Significant plasma CD105 reduction was observed at
high dose levels. The reduction of CD105 was associated with induction of
plasma VEGF. Ten patients had stable disease, and the reduction of CD105
is associated with PSA stabilization.Conclusion: A significant induction
of VEGF was associated with CD105 reduction at three high dose levels,
suggesting the anti-angiogenic activity of TRC105. Exploratory analysis
showed a tentative correlation between the reduced CD105 and a decreased
PSA velocity, suggestive of potential antitumor activity of TRC105 in
metastatic prostate cancer.
