Title: Metformin enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis by Mcl-1 degradation
via Mule in colorectal cancer cells


Recent studies have reported that metformin is an anti-diabetic drug, and
is the potential a promising anti-cancer agent. The purpose of this study
is to evaluate whether metformin effectively sensitize human colorectal
cancer (CRC) cells to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. Metformin alone did
not induce apoptosis, but significantly potentiated TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in CRC cells. CRC cells treated with metformin and TRAIL
activated the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of caspase activation. To
elucidate the underlying mechanism, we found that metformin significantly
reduced the protein levels of Mcl-1 (Myeloid cell leukemia 1) in CRC
cells, and overexpression of Mcl-1 attenuated the cell death by metformin
alone, or in combination with TRAIL. Further experiments revealed that
metformin did not affect the mRNA level, but proteasomal degradation and
protein stability of Mcl-1. The metformin-induced degradation of Mcl-1
required the E3 ligase Mule, which is responsible for the
polyubiquitination of Mcl-1. Taken together, our study is the first
report indicating that metformin enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis through
the degradation of Mcl-1 by the proteasome machinery.
