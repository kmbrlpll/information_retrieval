Title: SCUBE2 is a co-receptor for VEGFR2 in tumor angiogenesis


Signal peptide-complement protein C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp1 (CUB)-epidermal
growth factor (EGF) domain-containing protein 2 (SCUBE2) is a peripheral
membrane protein expressed in normal tissue and tumor vascular
endothelial cells (ECs); however, its role in angiogenesis remains poorly
understood. In this study, we show that endothelial SCUBE2 is upregulated
by hypoxia and acts as a co-receptor for VEGFR2 to facilitate VEGF
binding to VEGFR2 and augment its signals including VEGFR2
phosphorylation and p44/42 MAPKs/Akt activation, thus promotes cell
proliferation and tubule formation in ECs. While physiological
angiogenesis remained normal in the endothelial ablation of Scube2 in
mice, pathological angiogenesis in experimental tumors was altered,
resulting in smaller tumors and reduced microvascular density. To
simulate the angiogenic environment of the tumor, Scube2-deficient ECs
were isolated and propagated in vitro with VEGF. Mutant ECs exhibited
marked reduction in binding of VEGF, proliferation and sprouting
responses to VEGF as well as downstream signal activation. Our results
reveal that SCUBE2 might act as a novel co-receptor for VEGFR2, and point
that targeting such SCUBE2 function in human ECs may represent a
potential anti-tumor strategy by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis.
