Title: A fully human anti-TIM3 antibody with co-stimulatory activity


Targeting immune checkpoint molecules has been demonstrated to have
significant benefit to patients with cancer. One such molecule is TIM3
whose expression is associated with a phenomenon referred to as T cell
exhaustion. While it has been suggested that ligation of TIM3 provides a
negative signal to the T cell, there is no obvious inhibitory signaling
motif associated with the molecule. We have developed a fully human
antibody to TIM3 which demonstrates potent co-stimulatory activity. T
cells stimulated with anti-CD3 plus either anti-CD28 or anti-TIM3 show
comparable levels of cell activation. Similar to co-stimulation with
anti-CD28, the anti-TIM3 antibody promotes expression of CD25, interferon
gamma, Tbet and granzyme B, amongst others. Thus, anti-TIM3
co-stimulation promotes T cells with a pro-inflammitory phenotype. With
TIM3 being associated with exhausted T cells, co-stimulation with this
antibody would be expected to specifically re-activate these exhausted T
cells at the tumor site. Moreover, since some NK cells constitutively
express TIM3, it would be expected that this antibody would activate
these cells as well. Altogether, we have identified a novel anti-TIM3
antibody that is capable of targeting T cells at the tumor site and
activating them.
