Title: Color-coded imaging of the tumor microenvironment of malignant
lymphoma in a syngeneic mouse model


EL4-RFP lymphoma cells were injected in the spleen of C57/BL6 GFP
transgenic mice. EL4-RFP metastasis was observed in the lymph nodes of
the supra mediastinum and abdomen and in the liver 28 days later. The
EL4-RFP tumors in the spleen (primary injection site), liver, supra
mediastinum lymph nodes, abdominal lymph nodes, bone marrow, and lung
were visualized with the Olympus FV1000 scanning laser confocal
microscope. EL4-RFP tumors in the liver, lymph nodes, and bone marrow in
C57/BL6 GFP mice were rich in GFP stromal cells such as macrophages,
fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and normal lymphocytes derived from the
host animal. Phagocytosis of EL4-RFP lymphoma cells by macrophages, as
well as dendritic cells and fibroblasts, were observed in culture. Small
tumors were observed in the spleen (primary injection site), but the
stroma cells in the spleen tumors were abundant. We could observe that in
the lung, no mass formation of lymphoma cells occurred, but lymphoma
cells circulated in lung peripheral blood vessels.
