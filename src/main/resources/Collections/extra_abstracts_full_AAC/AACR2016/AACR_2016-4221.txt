Title: Imaging formation of the tumor microenvironment in orthotopic
liver tumors in red fluorescent protein (RFP) transgenic nude mice


We report here dual-color imaging of the formation of the TME in
orthotopic liver cancer in transgenic red fluorescent protein (RFP) nude
mice, which express RFP in all organs. Non-colored HUH-7 human hepatoma
cells were injected in the spleen of RFP nude mice to establish an
orthotopic liver cancer model. TME formation in the liver tumor was
observed using the Olympus OV100 small animal fluorescence imaging
system. Non-colored liver cancer cells formed colonies in the liver 28
days after cell transplantation to the spleen. In the liver, RFP
host-mouse cells accumulated around and in the liver tumor as visualized
by fluorescence imaging. A desmin and sirus-red positive area increased
around and within the liver tumor over time. These results indicate
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were recruited by the liver
metastasis suggesting that CAFs, along with the angiogenic tumor blood
vessels, could serve as visible therapeutic targets.
