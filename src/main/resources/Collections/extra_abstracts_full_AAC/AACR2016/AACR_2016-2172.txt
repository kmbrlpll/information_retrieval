Title: Circle Akt in: Epitope catalyzed assembly of macrocyclic
therapeutics against phosphorylated Akt


An approach to drugging undruggable target proteins using macrocyclic,
epitope targeted peptide based affinity reagents is demonstrated. An
unbiased comprehensive Cu-catalyzed Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition cyclized
peptide macrocyclic library is synthesized and screened against the
phoshoS474 containing Hydrophobic Motif (HM) peptide epitope of Akt2. The
best macrocyclic ligand, which exhibits specificity at the peptide and
protein levels, is further extended through an in situ click screen to
yield bivalent macrocyclic reagent with high affinity and specificity.
The bivalent peptide, targeted against the phospho-S474 region of Akt,
inhibits the Akt kinase in in vitro kinase assays. This ligand is being
optimized, through systematic changes in its composition, to increase its
cell permeability characteristics, so that its effects can be studied in
Akt overexpressing carcinoma cell lines. The optimized macrocyclic
peptide can eventually be used as an in vivo imaging probe and as a
peptide inhibitor drug.
