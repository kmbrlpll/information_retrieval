Title: Small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors induce apoptosis and death in
multiple cancer subtypes in vitro


Mcl-1 is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that play a major role
in conferring resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells. Inhibiting Mcl-1
using peptides or RNAi has been shown to induce apoptosis in a broad
array of cancer cell lines in numerous studies, making Mcl-1 a compelling
target for anticancer therapy. We have discovered potent and selective
small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors that bind to the BH3 binding site of
Mcl-1 with sub nanomolar affinities. These agents rapidly induced
apoptosis in the Mcl-1 dependent NCI-H929 myeloma cell line, as
demonstrated by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, caspase
activation, and decreased viability. We measured the anti-proliferative
activity of our compounds in cell lines from several cancer subtypes and
found a broad spectrum of sensitivity to Mcl-1 inhibition. In cell lines
that were resistant to Mcl-1 antagonists, combination with the dual
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-263 (navitoclax) greatly enhanced the activity
of both compounds. These findings demonstrate that pharmacologic
inhibition of Mcl-1 as a single agent or in combination with other cancer
therapeutic agents is an effective way to modulate the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway and promote cell death in cancer cells.
