Title: Identification of selective inhibitors of diffuse-type gastric
cancer cells by screening of annotated compounds


Diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC) exhibits rapid disease progression and
a poor prognosis. We have reported an E-cadherin/p53 double conditional
knockout (DCKO) mouse line as the first genetically engineered one, which
morphologically and molecularly recapitulates human DGC. We have also
established mouse gastric cancer (GC) cell lines from DGC of the DCKO
mice, demonstrating strong resistance to cytotoxic anti-cancer agents and
high tumorigenic property when subcutaneously injected to nude mice.
Then, we performed a synthetic lethal screening of 1535 annotated
chemical compounds, and identified 27 candidates with selective
inhibitory activity against the GC cell lines. These candidate drugs were
classified into some classes, and members of the most potent class
specifically attenuated cell proliferation of the GC cell lines by
induction of apoptosis as well as suppressing tumor growth in vivo.
Expectedly, E-cadherin-mutant and -low human gastric cancer cell lines
were more sensitive to them in contrast to E-cadherin-intact ones. These
findings may lead to development of novel drugs and discovery of
potential targets in human DGC.
