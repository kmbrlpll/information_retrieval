Title: TCR sequencing can identify and track tumor-specific T cell
populations and is a predictive biomarker of response to DC vaccination
in glioblastoma patients


While immunotherapeutic strategies are emerging adjunctive treatments for
cancer, sensitive methods of monitoring the immune response after
treatment remain to be established. We used a novel next generation
sequencing (NGS) approach to determine whether quantitative assessments
of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) content and the degree of overlap
of T cell receptor (TCR) sequences in brain tumors and peripheral blood
were predictors of immune response and overall survival in glioblastoma
(GBM) patients treated with autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell
(DC) immunotherapy. A significant correlation was found between a higher
estimated TIL content and increased time to progression (TTP) and overall
survival (OS). In addition, we were able to assess the proportion of
shared TCR sequences between tumor and peripheral blood at time points
before and after therapy, and found the level of TCR overlap to correlate
with survival outcomes. Higher degrees of overlap, or the development of
an increased overlap following immunotherapy, correlated with improved
clinical outcome, and may provide insights into the successful,
antigen-specific immune response.
