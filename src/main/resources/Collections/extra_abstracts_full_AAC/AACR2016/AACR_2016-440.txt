Title: Quantification of somatic chromosomal rearrangements in
circulating cell-free DNA from ovarian cancers


Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provides great potential for the
non-invasive clinical assessment of tumor burden. We developed a
monitoring protocol using next generation mate-pair sequencing to
identify chromosomal rearrangement signatures in primary tumors to follow
ctDNA in blood. Primary tumors of 10 patients with ovarian cancer were
sequenced, and individualized tumor-specific panels were designed to
detect the junctions in ctDNA. A novel algorithm was developed and
applied to data generated by quantitative PCR to calculate the percent of
ctDNA. Selected junctions, some with potential as therapeutic targets,
were detected in pre-surgically drawn blood in eight out of ten patients.
Of these eight, three demonstrated the continued presence of circulating
tumor DNA post-surgery, and five had undetectable levels, consistent with
their documented presence or absence of disease. The detection of somatic
junctions derived from ctDNA could be an effective way to monitor ovarian
cancer patients for relapse and therapy response.
