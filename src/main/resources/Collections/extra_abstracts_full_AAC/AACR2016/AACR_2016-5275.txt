Title: An integrated pipeline for TCGA data analysis


The accumulation of publicly available high-throughput experimental data
has made analyzing the data a bottleneck in scientific discovery. In this
study, we explore a computational, high-throughtput approach for
identifying cancer related biological factors using the data available at
the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We developed an integrative genomic
analysis (IGA) tool, which performs multiple analysis tasks, including
gene/protein level differential expression analysis, gene set level
enrichment analysis and network/pathway level comparison. Several data
types can be analyzed, including RNA-seq, DNA methylation, miRNA-seq, and
proteomics. By varying cancer types, race groups, and data types, we are
able to generate a large set of novel findings, which may serve as
experimental targets for biologists and biochemists. Interactive reports
are generated to facilitate further exploration of the biological
significance of findings. With the high-throughput approach and
intgrative tools, the bottlenect for us now shifts to publishing these
results. We invite researchers in cancer research community to
collaborate with us to publish the findings.
