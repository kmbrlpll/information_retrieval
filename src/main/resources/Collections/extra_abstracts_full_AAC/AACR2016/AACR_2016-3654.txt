Title: In vivo CRISPR screen identidied Nf1 as a new tumor suppressor
recurrently inactivated in liver cancer


Our CRISPR screen identified NF1, encoding a RasGAP, as a new
tumor-suppressor gene. CRISPR mediated loss-of-function mutations in NF1
led to increase RAS activation and increased tumor formation in liver
cells. NF1 expression was reduced in 60% (225/373) of human HCC and was
associated with reduced patient survival. Point mutations of NF1 was
found in 3% of HCC. These findings identify NF1 inactivation as a new
tumor suppressor in the liver and highlight the importance of RasGAPs in
liver cancer.
