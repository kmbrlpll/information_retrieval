Title: Stem cell-engineered invariant natural killer T cells for cancer
therapy.


Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells comprise a small population of
αβ T lymphocytes. They bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems
and mediate strong and rapid responses to many diseases, including
cancer, infections, allergies and autoimmunity. However, the study of
iNKT cell biology and the therapeutic applications of these cells are
greatly limited by their small numbers in vivo (~0.01-1% in mouse and
human blood). Here, we report a new method to generate large numbers of
iNKT cells in mice through T cell receptor (TCR) gene engineering of
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We showed that iNKT TCR-engineered HSCs
could generate a clonal population of iNKT cells. These HSC-engineered
iNKT cells displayed the typical iNKT cell phenotype and functionality.
They followed a two-stage developmental path, first in thymus and then in
the periphery, resembling that of endogenous iNKT cells. When tested in a
mouse melanoma lung metastasis model, the HSC-engineered iNKT cells
effectively protected mice from tumor metastasis. This method provides a
powerful and high-throughput tool to investigate the in vivo development
and functionality of clonal iNKT cells in mice. More importantly, this
method takes advantage of the self-renewal and longevity of HSCs to
generate a long-term supply of engineered iNKT cells, thus opening up a
new avenue for iNKT cell-based immunotherapy.
