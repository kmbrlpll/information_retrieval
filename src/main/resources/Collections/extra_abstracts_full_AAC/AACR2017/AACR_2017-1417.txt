Title: Expression of BARD1δ induces genetic instability and is
associated with cervical carcinogenesis.


Cervical cancer is always linked to infection with the human papilloma
virus (HPV), which causes hyper-proliferation of cervical epithelial
cells and neoplasia and cervical cancer. The viral oncoprotein
interaction with host tumor suppressor proteins partially explains the
uncontrolled proliferation, which ultimately progresses to cervical
cancer. However, little is known about the specific factors that promote
or inhibit the malignant transformation. Since a portion of HPV
infections never evolves into cancer, the identification of
discriminatory factors would be an important step towards the development
of prognostic and therapeutic tools.

Based on this notion, we investigated whether an isoform of BARD1,
BARD1δ, which we found frequently expressed in cancer cells, plays a
role in the malignant transformation of cervical epithelial cells. Using
immunohystochemistry staining on tissue sections and RT-PCR we found that
BARD1δ is expressed in proliferating cervical cancer cells, while normal
BARD1 is repressed. BARD1 might be a driver of carcinogenesis and might
be a critical event in the progression from hyper-proliferating cervical
epithelium after HPV infection to cervical cancer.

Together, our results show that an isoform of BARD1, BARD1δ, is
increasingly expressed in precancerous stages of cervical cancer and the
specific inhibition of BARD1δ may represent a novel approach for
therapeutic interventions to prevent cervical carcinogenesis after HPV
infection.
