Title: The role of A-to-I RNA editing in human cancer.


Recent studies show that A-to-I RNA editing introduces a large number of
specific nucleotide changes in cancer transcriptomes. Using the
genomic/transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we
systematically characterized the landscape of RNA editing in a variety of
cancer types and revealed many sites with clinically relevant patterns.
We further integrated proteomic data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor
Analysis Consortium and found that mutations and RNA editing introduced
similar numbers of amino acids changes per tumor sample in breast and
ovarian cancers. The amino acid changes engendered by these RNA editing
events may significantly alter protein stability. Some of the identified
RNA editing events show critical consequent changes driving tumor growth
and altering therapeutic activity. We also identified the RNA editing
hotspots in miRNAs across cancer types, and some of RNA editing events
modify the miRNA target genes. They could function as potential
therapeutic targets and therapeutics. Our study suggests a large
contribution of A-to-I RNA editing to protein diversity and gene
regulation, and highlights its translational potential as both biomarkers
and therapeutic targets.
