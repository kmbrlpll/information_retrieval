Title: PTEN-L regulates epithelial growth and macrophage function.


PTEN is among the most frequently mutated and deleted tumor suppressor
genes in many malignancies, including breast cancer. An alternatively
translated long form of PTEN, termed PTEN-L, has divergent functionality
from PTEN, although its function at the organism level has not been
studied. Here, we report a knockout mouse with specific ablation of
PTEN-L expression but intact expression of PTEN. These mice display
mammary ductal hyperplasia characterized by increased luminal growth and
increased numbers of macrophages in the surrounding stroma. Macrophages
are particularly affected by PTEN-L loss, with significant changes to
their secretomes and functional deficiencies in clearing bacterial
infections, consistent with a shift toward an M2-like polarization.
Overall, these findings demonstrate that PTEN-L has unique functions in
regulating mammary epithelial growth and macrophage functionality that
are independent of canonical PTEN.
