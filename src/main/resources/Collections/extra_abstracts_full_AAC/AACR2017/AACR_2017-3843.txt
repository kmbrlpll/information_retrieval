Title: Autologous resconstitution of human cancer and immune system in
vivo.


Correlative studies from checkpoint inhibitor trials have indcated that
better understanding of human leukocytic trafficking into the human tumor
microenvironment can expedite the translation of future immune-oncologic
agents. In order to directly characterize signaling pathways that can
regulate human leukocytic trafficking into the tumor, we have developed a
completely autologous xenotransplanation method to reconstitute the human
tumor immune microenvironment in vivo. When we analyzed the TCGA database
of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma(HNSCC), we found that
STAT3 signaling was associated with worse prognostic mesenchymal subtye.
We silenced STAT3 signaling in the tumor compartment in these
autologously reconstituted humanized mice, and we noted increased tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes and slower tumor growth rate. We also used this
novel agents that can alter endogenous leukocytic infiltration into the
tumor. Taken together, we present a valuable method to study
individialized human tumor microenvironments in vivo without confound
allgeneic responses.
