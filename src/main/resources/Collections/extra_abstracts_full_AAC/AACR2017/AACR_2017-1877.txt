Title: Coordination of Rac1 and Cdc42 by centrosomal microtubules in
focal adhesion dynamics and directed cell migration.


Cancer metastasis causes the increase of mortality in most cancer
patients, and abnormal cell migration contributes to this disease
progression. To control cell migration, the dynamical control of a
protein complex within focal adhesions has to be regulated appropriately.
It is known that focal adhesions can be regulated dynamically by
microtubules. To examine the effects of centrosomal microtubules and
non-centrosomal microtubules in regulating focal adhesion dynamics and
directed cell migration, we first generated centrosome-deficient cells.
We find that centrosomal microtubules and non-centrosomal microtubules
control focal adhesion dynamics through modulating focal adhesion
composition, which dynamically control the activity of small GTPases Rac1
and Cdc42. Deficiency of centrosomal microtubules significantly disrupts
the balance of Rac1 and Cdc42, thereby inhibiting directed cell
migration. This study reveals the effects of centrosome in focal
adhesions, and indicates an important role for Rac1 and Cdc42 activation
that controls actin polymerization, cell polarization and directed cell
migration.
