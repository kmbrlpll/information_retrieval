Title: MYC functions as a master switch for natural killer cell-mediated
immune surveillance of lymphoid malignancies.


The MYC oncogene drives the pathogenesis of many hematopoietic
malignancies, including Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) and Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia (ALL). These malignancies are often “oncogene-addicted” to
MYC. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF), we demonstrate that MYC-addicted T-ALL
excludes specific immune subsets from the tumor microenvironment
implicated in immune surveillance, including natural killer (NK) cells.
MYC inhibition clears malignant lymphocytes from the spleen and restores
the normal splenic NK composition. Concordantly, peripheral blood of
T-ALL patients have reduced percentages of activated NK cells as compared
to healthy individuals. We show that MYC excludes activated NK cells from
sites of lymphomagenesis by suppressing ERK1/2-STAT1/2-Type I IFN
signaling, in both murine and human lymphomas. Furthermore,
MYC-associated BL patients with higher than median expression of STAT1/2,
and cytotoxic NK cell genes, PRF1 and Granzymes, have favorable clinical
outcomes. Hence, oncogenic MYC appears to causally and reversibly
suppress NK-mediated immune surveillance during lymphomagenesis.
