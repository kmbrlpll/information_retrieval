Title: Inhibition of STAT3 overcomes gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic
cancer cells.


Gemcitabine is used as the first line treatment of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), however, either innate or acquired resistance to
gemcitabine limit its therapeutic efficacy. In this study, several DNA
damage agents including DNA repair inhibitors, and kinase inhibitors were
examined for suppression of cell growth of gemcitabine resistant cells.
The results show that most of these compounds are cross-resistant to
gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cells. By using STRING protein network
database, we found that STAT3 signaling pathway plays a connectional role
to link targeted proteins we tested. Interestingly, gemcitabine-resistant
pancreatic cells have higher level of phosphor-STAT3 (pSTAT3) and are
more sensitive to STAT3 inhibitor, S3I-201. Furthermore, combined S3I-201
with gemcitabine synergically suppresses the growth of both cell lines in
vitro. We also confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of combined treatments
using xenografted model. Taken together, inhibition of STAT3 overcomes
gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cells. This study may provide
us with a new approach to treat pancreatic cancer as well as gemcitabine
resistance of pancreatic cancer.
