Title: IgH enhancers hs3b/hs4 are dispensable for c-Myc deregulation in
mouse plasmacytomas with T(12;15) translocations.


c-Myc deregulating t(12;15) chromosomal translocation is the hallmark
cytogenetic abnormality of murine plasmacytomas (PCTs). In the great
majority of PCTs, the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus is broken
between Eμ enhancer and the 3’ regulatory region (3’RR), making the
latter the major candidate for orchestrating c-Myc deregulation. To
elucidate the role of 3’RR in tumorigenesis, we induced PCTs in mice
deficient for the major 3’RR enhancer elements, namely hs3b and hs4
(3’KO). Unexpectedly, and contrary to the previous observations made in
a mouse lymphoma model, Hs3b/Hs4 3’KO mice did develop
t(12;15)-positive PCTs, although with a lower incidence than wild-type
controls. In heterozygous mice, there was no allelic bias in targeting
IgH for the t(12;15). Molecular analysis of IgH/Myc junctions revealed
dominance of Sμ region breakpoints compared to the prevalence of hits
into Sγ or Sα in the controls. Analysis of c-Myc expression as well as
Ig secretion in 3’KO PCT cell lines revealed no significant differences
from the controls. Our current findings highlight the complexity of the
3’RR and the potential of its components to compensate for each other
in the context of differentiation from B-lymphocyte to plasma cell. We
next extended our observations to include a PCT model where Cre-mediated
deletion can remove all four 3'IgH enhancers: hs3a, hs1,2, hs3b and hs4.
In PCT cell lines where c-Myc is translocated to an IgH BAC transgene
with a floxed 3’IgH enhancer region, induction of
retrovirally-expressed Cre-recombinase causes gradual Myc downregulation
and complete cell death within 96 hours. The later observation confirms
the requirement of the full 3’RR for c-Myc deregulation by T(12;15).
