Title: Unmasking heterogeneity within the adult mammary stem cell
compartment.


Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease at both the molecular and
pathological levels. To understand this heterogeneity and ‘cells of
origin’ of breast cancer, it is important to dissect the normal mammary
epithelial hierarchy. Despite accumulating evidence for a mammary
differentiation hierarchy, the basal compartment comprising stem cells
remains poorly characterized. Through gene expression profiling of Lgr5+
versus Lgr5– basal epithelial cells, we identify a novel marker that
led to the fractionation of three distinct mammary stem cell (MaSC)
subsets in the adult gland. These exist in a largely quiescent state but
differ in their repopulating ability, spatial localisation, and their
molecular signatures. Interestingly, the dormant MaSC subset localises to
the proximal region of the gland throughout life. These cells appear to
originate from the embryonic mammary primordia before switching to a
quiescent state post-natally but can be recruited into the cell cycle in
response to hormones. Single cell gene expression analyses have also
revealed unexpected complexity within the basal and luminal compartments.
Moreover, analyses at different stages of development have provided
insights into the earliest ‘lineage priming’ events.
