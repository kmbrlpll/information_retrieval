Title: Adhesion and entry of gold nanoparticles into breast cancer cells:
Nanoparticles for localized drug delivery/hyperthermia.


The specific targeting of breast cancer cells is important for the early
detection and treatment of

cancer cells /tumor tissue, hence the drive for the development of
nanoparticles. This paper

presents results of an atomic force microscopy study on the adhesion
between triple negative

breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) and biosynthesized gold
nanoparticles

(GNP) conjugated with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) which
is known to

target LHRH receptors that are over-expressed on the surfaces of breast
cancer cells. It also

estimates time scales for Gold nanoparticle entry into cells by means of
an analytical model. The

adhesion forces between the LHRH-conjugated gold nanoparticles and the
breast cancer cells are

found to be about 4-5 times greater than those between normal breast
cells and LHRH-

conjugated gold nanoparticles. The increase in the adhesion of LHRH to
breast cancer cells is

shown to be associated with an increase in the LHRH receptor density,
which is revealed using

confocal microscopy. The implications of the results are discussed for
localized treatment of

breast cancer.
