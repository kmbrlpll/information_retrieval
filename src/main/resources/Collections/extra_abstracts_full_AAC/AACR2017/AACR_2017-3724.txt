Title: PDL1 protein expression and tumor mutation burden in hematologic
malignancies: correlation with Hodgkin and high grade lymphoma.


Background: The success of anti PD–1 therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma has
led to clinical trials in other types of lymphomas. However, there is
limited data on PD–L1 expression in acute leukemias. In this study, we
analyzed PD–L1 protein expression and tumor mutational burden in
various hematologic malignancies including leukemias, lymphomas and
myelomas.

Methods: In the IHC cohort, formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections
from 92 hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid and
lymphoblastic leukemia (AML, ALL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (LGNHL) and
myeloma were immunostained using the FDA approved PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx
assay [monoclonal mouse anti-PD–L1 antibody (DAKO clone 22C3)]. Any
perceptible partial or complete membrane staining in all viable tumor
cells was scored as follows: 50%-high level PD-L1 expression. In the
second cohort of 2064 cases, comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was
performed using a hybrid–capture, adaptor ligation assay to a mean
depth of >672X. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was calculated from a minimum
of 1.11MB of sequenced DNA as previously described and reported as
mutations/MB.

High PD–L1 expression was noted in 100% of HL. DLBCL showed
significantly higher PD–L1 positivity compared to LGNHL (p=0.01). No
correlation for PD–L1 expression was noted between AML and ALL (p =
0.2). On CGP analysis of the second cohort, TMB was significantly higher
in DLBCL as compared to LGNHL (pHigh PD–L1 expression was noted in 100%
of HL. DLBCL showed significantly higher PD–L1 positivity compared to
LGNHL (p=0.01). No correlation for PD–L1 expression was noted between
AML and ALL (p = 0.2). On CGP analysis of the second cohort, TMB was
significantly higher in DLBCL as compared to LGNHL (p<0.0001).

Conclusion: The high PD-L1 expression in both HL and DLBCL and high TMB
in DLBCL may be linked to enhanced responsiveness to check point
inhibitor therapy in these cancers. PD-L1 expression and TMB are
relatively infrequent and at low levels in acute leukemias. Additionally,
novel anti PD–1/PD–L1 therapeutic strategies are worthy of
consideration for both advanced stage refractory/relapsed acute myeloid
and lymphoblastic leukemias.

Results: PD-L1 expression and TMB are tabulated below.
