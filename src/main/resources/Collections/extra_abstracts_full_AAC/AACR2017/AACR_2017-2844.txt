Title: Identification of genes associated with pancreatic cancer
metastasis by genome-wide CRISPR Cas9 screening.


Pancreatic cancer is an extremely lethal cancer with a 5-year survival
rate of 7%. One major reason why pancreatic cancer is hard to treat is
its metastasis nature. Genes that related to the tumorigenesis and
progression of pancreatic cancer were identified after decades of
efforts. Several researches had revealed that pancreatic cancer
originated from the successive accumulation of gene mutations, especially
KRAS2, CNKD2A, TP53 and SMAD4. However, little is known about genes that
regulate pancreatic cancer metastasis. Here we used a genome wide CRISPR
Cas9 screening to identify the gene(s) associated with the metastasis of
pancreatic cancer. We transduced pancreatic cancer cell line with
lentivirus-based genome wide CRISPR sgRNA library to establish mutated
cell library, and orthotopically injected the cell library into nude mice
and waited for primary tumor growth and metastasis, then collected
primary and metastatic tumors after several months. By next generation
sequencing and analysis, we identified some gene candidates which may
play important roles on pancreatic cancer metastasis.
