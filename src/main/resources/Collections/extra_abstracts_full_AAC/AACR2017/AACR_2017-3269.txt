Title: Impact of gender on survival of the patients with esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma at a single institute in China.


Esophageal cancer (EC) has been well documented with predominant
occurrence in male and with major histopathological type of esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in China. However, the influence by gender
on ESCC survival is largely unknown in China. The present study was thus
undertaken to elucidate the impact by gender on survival of Chinese
patients with ESCC. A total of 17,969 ESCC patients was enrolled in this
study, including 11,127 males with a mean age of 60.2±8.6 and 6842
females with a mean age of 61.0±8.4.All the patients were from ESCC
database in Henan Key Laboratory for Esophageal Cancer Research of the
First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University (1975 to 2015). Only the
patients with T2–4N0–1M0–1 were enrolled in this study. Based on
the diagnosed time, the patients were classified into two groups, group I
(1996–2005, 6885/38.3%) and group II (2006–2015, 11084/61.7%). The
followed–up was undertaken until October, 2016. Kaplan–Meier models
were for describing the survival curves and Cox proportional hazards
models were undertaken to observe the risk of death of male and female.
The results demonstrated that the male patients had a poor survival than
female (Χ2=58.17, PEsophageal cancer (EC) has been well documented with
predominant occurrence in male and with major histopathological type of
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in China. However, the
influence by gender on ESCC survival is largely unknown in China. The

Kaplan–Meier models were for describing the survival curves and Cox
proportional hazards models were undertaken to observe the risk of death
of male and female. The results demonstrated that the male patients had a
poor survival than female (Χ2=58.17, P<0.001). Furthermore, similar
results were observed for the two different periods of 1996–2005
(Χ2=21.08, PEsophageal cancer (EC) has been well documented with
predominant occurrence in male and with major histopathological type of

(Χ2=34.67, P<0.001). The present results indicate that gender is an
independent survival factor for ESCC and the female patients with ESCC
have a dramatic prolonged survival than male patients in China.
