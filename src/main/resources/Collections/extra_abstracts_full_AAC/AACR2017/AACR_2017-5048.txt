Title: Residual concentrations of cetuximab predict clinical response in
head and neck cancer patients.


Cetuximab administration is contingent upon the upfront determination of
Ras mutational status, because mutated patients are unlikely to respond
to this therapy. In addition to tumor genomics, drug exposure levels
could be a critical yet largely underestimated issue, because several
reports have already demonstrated that cetuximab pharmacokinetic
parameters (i.e., clearance values) could be associated with survival in
patients. Here, we have developed an original bioanalytical method based
upon the use of LC-MS/MS technology and a highly simplified sample
preparation procedure to assay cetuximab in patients while meeting the
requirements of standard therapeutic drug monitoring in routine clinical
practice. We used this method prospectively to evaluate the inter-patient
variability in drug exposure, and to search whether those exposure levels
could be associated with clinical endpoints. A total of 25 adult patients
(22 M, 3F, mean age: 69 years) hospitalized for head and neck cancer and
scheduled for a cetuximab-containing regimen (250 mg/m² QW) were
included to perform this pilot study. Seven patients received concomitant
radiotherapy and 14 patients received concomitant chemotherapy. 28% of
patients displayed severe toxicities (CTC grading). Following RECIST
assessment, 10 out of 25 patients (40%) had progressive disease and 60%
were categorized as patients with clinical benefit (stable disease: 5
patients (20%), partial response: 7 patients (28%), complete response: 3
patients (12%)). A large inter-patient variability was observed among
individuals. Mean cetuximab residual concentrations were 40.3 ± 20.3
µg/ml (CV: 51%, range 0-74.6 µg/ml) and mean cetuximab maximal
concentrations were 126.9 ± 39.6 µg/ml (CV: 31%, range 65.1-210.6
µg/ml). No statistical difference was observed in cetuximab residual
concentrations between patients with and without severe toxicities (36.7
± 21.2 µg/ml VS. 41.8 ± 20 µg/ml, p>0.05, t test), nor in maximal
cetuximab concentrations (117.1 ± 31.3 µg/ml VS. 130.3 ± 39.70 µg/ml,
p>0.05, t test). Conversely, when comparing exposure levels in patients
with clinical benefit to non-responding patients, a statistical
difference was found in both cetuximab residual concentrations (49 ±
16.3 µg/ml VS. 25.8 ± 17 µg/ml, pCetuximab administration is

µg/ml was the Cmin level associated with a probability of clinical
benefit with 86% of sensitivity and 75% of specificity. These results
advocate for the development of mass spec-based therapeutic drug
monitoring of cetuximab in head and neck cancer patients. In addition to
tumor molecular biology, drug exposure could be indeed a valuable
actionable item to improve efficacy of cetuximab at bedside.
