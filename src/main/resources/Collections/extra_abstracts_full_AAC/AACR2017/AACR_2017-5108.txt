Title: Potent small molecule compounds that selectively inhibit
proliferation of ABC-DLBCL cell lines.


Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which accounts for 25% of all
lymphomas cases, has been classified into molecular subtypes including
germinal center B cell like (GCB) DLBCL, activated B cell-like (ABC)
DLBCL, and primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBL). Among these
subtypes, patients with ABC-DLBCLs have the worst prognosis because of
the high chemo-resistance, and require effective therapies.

Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 (MALT1)
protease activity is linked to the pathogenesis of ABC-DLBCL. Therefore,
a focused library of covalent compounds selected based on molecular
docking on the reported crystal structure was screened for selective
sensitivity to ABC-DLBCL, but not GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Optimization of
initial hits resulted in the identification of lead compounds with an
anti-proliferative EC50 of 10 over cellular EC50 for up to 8 hours. The
lead compounds showed dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in a
xenograft model upon oral dosing.

In summary, we have identified novel and potent MALT1 inhibitors capable
of selectively inhibiting proliferation of DLBCL cell lines with
optimized drug-like properties including oral bioavailability. The data
presented here strongly support further development of these compounds
for DLBCL and other indications.
