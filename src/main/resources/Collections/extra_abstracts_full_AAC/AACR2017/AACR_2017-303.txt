Title: Oncogenic activity of amplified miniature chromosome maintenance 8
in human malignancies.


Miniature chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins play critical roles in
DNA replication licensing, initiation and elongation. MCM8, one of the
MCM proteins playing critical role in DNA repairing and recombination,
was found to have over-expression and increased DNA copy number in a
variety of human malignancies. The gain of MCM8 is associated with
aggressive clinical features of several human cancers. Increased
expression of MCM8 in prostate cancer is associated with cancer
recurrence. Forced expression of MCM8 in RWPE1 cells, the immortalized
but non-transformed prostate epithelial cell line, exhibited fast cell
growth and transformation, while knocked down of MCM8 in PC3, DU145 and
LNCaP cells induced cell growth arrest, and decreased tumor volumes and
mortality of severe combined immunodeficiency mice xenografted with PC3
and DU145 cells. MCM8 bound cyclin D1 and activated Rb protein
phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 in vitro and in vivo. The
cyclin D1/MCM8 interaction is required for Rb phosphorylation and for S
phase entry in cancer cells. As a result, our study showed that copy
number increase and overexpression of MCM8 may play critical roles in
human cancer development.
