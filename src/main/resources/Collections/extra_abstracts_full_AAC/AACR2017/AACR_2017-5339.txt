Title: Molecular phylogenetic classification of human papillomaviruses
and cancer associated genes: In correlation with cervical cancer
manifestation.


Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a diverse group of small double
stranded Deoxyribonucleic acid viruses implicated in many malignancies
including cervical cancer. The viruses are also attributed to
premalignant epithelial lesions in this disease. Cervical cancer is a
leading course of morbidity and mortality in African women and beyond. We
aimed to study the molecular phylogenetic classification of HPVs and
cervical cancer associated genes in relation with tumour manifestation.
Phylogenetic tree was constructed based on nucleotide sequence alignments
using ClustalX 2.1 algorithms to classify 31 different HPV DNA virus
types and 10 cervical cancer associated genes. Study of
immunohistochemistry markers associated with cervical cancer pathology
was performed. The nucleotide sequences used include HPV- 1 (V01116),
HPV-14 (D90261), HPV-20 (D90262), HPV-21 (D90263), HPV-25 (D90264), HPV-5
(M22961), HPV-47 (M32305), HPV-8 (M12737), HPV-2 (X55964), HPV-57
(X55965), HPV-6: X00203), HPV-11 (M14119), HPV-13 (X62843), HPV-43
(HE962420.1 E6 gene), HPV-44 (U31788.1), HPV-42 (HE820226.1 E6 gene for
E6 protein), HPV-16 (K02718), HPV 16 (KJ869425.1 E6 and E7 variants),
HPV-35 (M74117), HPV-31 (J04353), HPV-52 (KJ869430.1), HPV-33 (M12732),
HPV-58 (D90400), HPV-51 (M62877), HPV-18 (X05015), HPV-45 (M27363),
HPV-39 (M38185), (ME180, M73258), HPV 16 (KJ869425.1 E6 and E7 variants),
Ki-67 (NM_002417.4), p53 (AB082923.1), EGFR (NM_005228.3), MYC
(M25803.1), KRAS (EF471957.1), TGF-B (AF254794.1) and RB (AH002963.2)
genes. The resulting phylogenetic tree provides a conventional
classification of the HPVs and the cancer genes into groups encompassing
the known tissue tropism and oncogenic potential of each gene type
associated with the disease. The implications of a phylogenetic taxonomy
on the diagnostic detection of HPVs as they relate to cervical cancer
associate genes are shown to be important in disease management.
