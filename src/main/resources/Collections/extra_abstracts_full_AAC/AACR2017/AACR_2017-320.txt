Title: Potential of targeting of MYC-driven cancers via CIP2A without
detrimental physiological effects.


Transcription factor MYC is a driver of many human cancers due to its
widespread effects on gene expression. An understanding of the mechanisms
determining MYC’s transcriptional and proliferation-promoting
activities in vivo could facilitate approaches for MYC targeting.
However, post-translational mechanisms that control MYC function in vivo
are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that MYC phosphorylation at
serine 62 enhances MYC accumulation on Lamin A/C-associated nuclear
structures and that the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor protein
CIP2A is required for this process. CIP2A is also critical for
serum-induced MYC phosphorylation and for MYC-elicited proliferation
induction in vitro. Complementary transgenic approaches and an intestinal
regeneration model further demonstrated the in vivo importance of CIP2A
and serine 62 phosphorylation for MYC activity upon DNA damage-induced
proliferation. However, targeting of CIP2A did not influence the normal
function of intestinal crypt cells or general well-being of the mice.
Meanwhile, in breast cancer cells, CIP2A depletion was shown to inhibit
the MYC serine 62 phosphorylation, MYC-mediated gene expression, and
anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, CIP2A supports MDA-MB-231
xenograft growth in nude mice. Therefore, results of these studies
collectively suggest for a novel opportunity to target MYC’s function
in MYC- driven cancers via CIP2A, and without detrimental physiological
effects.
