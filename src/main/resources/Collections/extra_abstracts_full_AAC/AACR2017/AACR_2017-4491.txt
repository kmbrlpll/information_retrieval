Title: Modulation of p63 expression by phosphorylation of RBM38 at S195
via miR-203.


p63, a p53 family protein, acts as a sequence-specific DNA-binding
transcriptional factor to regulate the expression of target genes
involving in various cellular processes, including growth suppression and
epithelial development. RBM38, a RNA-binding protein, is a target of p53
family and is known to interact with its target mRNAs and regulate their
expression via mRNA stability. Previously, we found that RBM38 negatively
regulates p63 mRNA stability through binding to the AU/U-rich element in
3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR). We also found that phosphorylation
of RBM38 at Ser195 alters the conformation and function of RBM38 protein.
However, it is unclear whether phosphorylation of RBM38 or miR-203 alters
the ability of RBM38 to regulate p63 expression. In this study, we found
that in both MCF7 and HaCaT cells, wild-type RBM38 and S195A mutant, but
not phosphor-mimic S195D mutant, inhibit p63 mRNA stability, suggesting
that Ser195 phosphorylation abrogates the ability of RBM38 to repress the
expression of p63. Importantly, we found that phosphorylation of RBM38
disrupts the binding of RBM38 to the U-rich element in p63 3′-UTR.
Additionally, we found that miR-203 inhibitor increases, whereas miR203
mimic decreases p63 expression through binding to p63 3′-UTR,
consistent with a previous report. Interestingly, we found that the
ability of RBM38 to repress p63 expression is disrupted by miR-203
inhibitor but enhanced by miR-203 mimic. Furthermore, we found that
wild-type RBM38 protein, but not phosphor-mimic S195D mutant, physically
interacts with Ago2, indicating that RBM38 may inhibit p63 mRNA stability
by modulating Ago2-miR-203 complex to bind to the U-rich element in p63
3′-UTR. Together, we uncovered a novel mechanism by which RBM38
modulates p63 expression via miR-203.
