Title: Epigenetic downregulation and growth inhibition of IGFBP7 in
gastric cancer.


Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) has been found to
be a tumor suppressor in several human cancers, but the role of IGFBP7 in
gastric cancer has not yet been fully investigated. In this study, we
examined the epigenetic downregulation of IGFBP7 expression in gastric
cancer. Analysis by qRT-PCR, western blot, and methylation specific-PCR
revealed that DNA methylation was inversely correlated with IGFBP7
expression, and the expression of IGFBP7 was restored after treatment
with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Immunohistochemistry showed that IGFBP7
expression was downregulated in 47.5% of advanced gastric cancer
patients. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that IGFBP7
expression and tumor stage were independent prognostic factors. In cell
culture, IGFBP7 knockdown increased gastric cancer cell growth, invasion,
and migration, whereas IGFBP7 overexpression in gastric cancer cells
showed cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Our data suggest that IGFBP7
functions as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer via an epigenetic
pathway.
