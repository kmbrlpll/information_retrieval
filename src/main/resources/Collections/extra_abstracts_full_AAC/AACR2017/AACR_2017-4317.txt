Title: EGLN1/c-Myc induced lymphoid-specific helicase inhibits
ferroptosis through lipid metabolic gene expression changes.


Ferroptosis has emerged as a new form of non-apoptotic cell death in
multiple human diseases. However, the epigenetic mechanisms of
ferroptosis remain poorly defined. We demonstrate that Lymphoid-specific
helicase (LSH), a DNA methylation modifier, interacts with WDR76 to
inhibit ferroptosis by activating lipid metabolism-associated genes,
including GLUT1, and ferroptosis related genes SCD1 and FADS2. These
effects are dependent on iron and lipid reactive oxygen species. We
further show that EGLN1 and c-Myc directly activate LSH expression by
inhibiting HIF-1Î±. Finally, we demonstrate that LSH functions as an
oncogene in lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our study
elucidates the molecular basis for a c-Myc/EGLN1-mediated induction of
LSH expression to inhibit ferroptosis, which can be exploited for the
development of therapeutic agents to target ferroptosis in cancer.
