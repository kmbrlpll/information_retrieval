Title: A noncoding function of TYRP1 mRNA promotes melanoma growth.


RNAs competition to bind miRNA has been proposed to influence biological
systems whether these RNAs are implicated in diseases onset is unclear.
Here, we report that TYRP1 mRNA, in addition to encoding
tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), indirectly governs cell
proliferation by sequestering miR-16 on non-canonical miRNA response
elements (MREs). Consequently, sequestered miR-16 is no longer able to
repress its mRNA targets such as RAB17, which we show is involved in
melanoma cell proliferation and invasion. Restoration of miR-16 tumor
suppressor function can be achieved in vitro by silencing TYRP1 or
increasing miR-16 expression levels. Importantly, TYRP1-dependent miR-16
sequestration can also be overcome in vivo using small oligonucleotides
that mask miR-16 binding sites on TYRP1 mRNA. Together, our findings
assign a pathogenic noncoding function to TYRP1 mRNA and underscore miRNA
displacement as a new antimelanoma targeted therapeutic approach.
