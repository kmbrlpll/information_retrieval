Title: Computational exploration of mechanistic determinants of antibody
drug-conjugate pharmacokinetics using quantitative systems pharmacology
modeling strategies.


The pharmacokinetics of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) therapeutics
typically show a discrepancy between the PK of total antibody (conjugated
and unconjugated antibody) and that of conjugated antibody, carrying one
or more payload molecules. This discrepancy is often attributed to
deconjugation (Kamath, 2014), however recent evidence suggests that the
underlying mechanisms may be more complex. This work employs a
computational quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP), or mechabistic
PK/PD approach to understand the impact of drug antibody ratio (DAR) and
the resulting changes in molecular properties on overall PK and relative
payload disposition as observed in preclinical and clinical studies. Our
work establishes the benefit of using computational models to design
novel ADCs and to optimize the discovery and development of existing ADCs.
