Title: A role for MST4 in organelle organization and breast cancer cell
vascular invasion.


There exist 5 Mammalian Sterile20-like (MST) kinases that are broadly
distributed into two subgroups. While MST1 and MST2 have established
roles in the canonical Hippo signaling pathway, MST3, MST4, and YSK1 are
known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell polarity. Here we
clarify distinct roles for MST3 vs. MST4 in breast cancer cell lines.
Stable knockdown of MST4, but not MST3, enhances the ability of breast
cancer cells to disrupt an endothelial monolayer as well as invade from
an endothelial network formed within a microfluidic device. In addition,
depletion of MST4 in MDA-MB-231 cells alters their morphology, induces
abnormalities in nuclear structure, and affects the organization of
cellular organelles like the Golgi apparatus. We conclude that, despite
their relative homology, MST4 versus MST3 uniquely impacts the
intracellular organelle status and vascular invasive behavior of breast
cancer cells.
