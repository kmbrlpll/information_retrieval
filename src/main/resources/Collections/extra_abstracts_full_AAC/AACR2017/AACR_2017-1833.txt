Title: Imaging-guided brain tumor surgery strategy based on a
triple-modality MRI-PET-fluorescence imaging probe and imaging analysis.


Precise brain tumor resection is valuable for increasing the 5-year
survival rate. However, the delineation of tumor margin is a major
challenge. Transferrin modified nanoprobes had the property of passing
the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we endeavored to use transferrin to
fabricate a triple-modality magnetic resonance imaging-PET-fluorescence
imaging molecule agent (MPF) which could improve diagnostic sensitivity
and specificity of the brain tumors in the imaging acquisition and
analysis. The localization of the tumor were determined by the MRI before
surgery. Glucose metabolism was derived from PET imaging which would be
an important influence factor for surgery strategy. Tumor margin was
delineated using the quick segmentation methods according to the
fluorescence imaging after craniotomy which could reduce residual tumor
after resection. Finally, tissues were sliced and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin every 5 mm. The histology results were processed
into a whole image which can be used to evaluate the accuracy of
intraoperative tumor margin. This three modality imaging-guided surgery
strategy is a promising method which will probably achieve its
application in clinical trials in near future.
