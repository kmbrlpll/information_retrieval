Title: Deubiquitination and stabilization of programmed cell death-ligand
1 by CSN5.


Chronic inflammation in cancer is often associated with disease
aggressiveness. Pro-inflammatory cytokines produced in the tumor
microenvironment lead to eradication of antitumor immunity and enhanced
tumor cell survival. In the current study, we identified TNFα as a major
factor triggering cancer cell immunosuppression against T cell
surveillance via stabilization of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).
We demonstrated that COP9 signalosome 5 (CSN5), induced by NF-κB p65, is
required for TNFα-mediated PD-L1 stabilization in cancer cells. CSN5
inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of PD-L1. The role of CSN5 in
modulating PD-L1 stabilization prompted us to use CSN5 inhibitor,
curcumin, to show that it could destabilize PD-L1. Curcumin reduced CSN5
activity to attenuate TNFα-mediated PD-L1 stabilization and enhanced
anti-tumor immunity. Preclinical data demonstrated inhibition of CSN5
sensitized cancer cells to anti-CTLA4 therapy, suggesting CSN5 inhibitor
may be a useful adjuvant to enhance immune-based therapies.
