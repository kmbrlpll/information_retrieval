Title: Statistical analyses of stable housekeeping gene expression in
cancer post-irradiation.


Ionizing radiation (IR) can induce DNA damage in human cells and result
in changes in gene expression. The changes could also include some of the
commonly used housekeeping genes (HKG), and thus making them unstable
over the time period after being exposed to radiation. Normalization of
housekeeping genes is critical for understanding gene expression
post-irradiation. Toward the validation of stable HKGs, cancer cell lines
from head and neck, non-small cell lung and pancreas were irradiated to
2, 4 and 6 Gy IR doses. Statistical analysis of RNA expression of
fourteen HKGs measured at 5 min to 48hrs post-irradiation reveal
tradition HKGs such as beta-actin (ACTB) and
glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) to be unstable, while TATA-Box
Binding Protein (TBP) and Importin 8 (IPO8) was identified as stable HKGs
in non-small lung and pancreas cell across all IR doses and time.
Interestingly in head and neck cancer, TBP is also found stable across
all IR doses and time. The statistical framework used for identification
and validation of HKGs can serve as a reliable metric for quantifying
gene expression post-irradiation.
