Title: Reactive oxygen species induced nuclear translocation of c-MET via
INTERNET mechanism.


c-MET is one of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are
overexpressed in malignant cancer types including breast cancer. c-MET is
traditionally known for its role in signaling transduction from the cell
surface, our recent publication provided evidence that c-MET can be
translocated into the nucleus and phosphorylate PARP1 in response to
reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulation (Du et al. Nat Med 2016).
Oxidative stress is a common phenomenon in cancer cells due to alteration
of metabolism, and constitutive oxidative stress related to ROS has been
observed in breast cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated that
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as well as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can
induce retrograde translocation of c-MET holoreceptor via a
membrane-bound vesicle transport mechanism and translocate into the
nucleus through INTERNET (integral trafficking from the ER to the nuclear
envelope transport pathway) (Wang et al. J Biol Chem 2012) in breast
cancer cells. While c-MET nuclear transportation increases dramatically
under H2O2 treatment, our findings provide a putative mechanism by which
breast cancer cells adapt to oxidative stress and suggest that INTERNET
might be a general nuclear translocation mechanism shared among RTKs.
