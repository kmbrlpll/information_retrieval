Title: S100A4 blockage alleviates agonistic anti-CD137 antibody induced
liver pathology without disruption of anti-tumor immunity.


Liver-related autoimmune toxicities triggered by anti-CD137 agonist
antibodies have greatly limited their use in clinic applications. Here we
found that anti-CD137 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment in mice induced
the infiltration of a large number of S100A4+ macrophages into the liver.
Depletion of these cells or deficiency of S100A4 decreased inflammatory
cytokine profiles, and drastically reduced the number of liver pathogenic
CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, soluble S100A4 directly activated the Akt
pathway and specifically prolonged CD8+ T cell survival. Interestingly,
one S100A4 neutralizing monoclonal antibody selectively alleviated liver
abnormalities but did not affect the anti-tumor immunity induced by
anti-CD137 therapy. Thus, our study presents a novel molecular link to
the liver pathology induced by an immune stimulatory antibody, and
proposes that combinational immunotherapies targeting those pathways
could potentially elicit optimal anti-tumor immunity with minimal side
effects.
