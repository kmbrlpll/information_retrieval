Title: Glycyl-tRNA Synthetase is a novel target for cancer therapeutics.


Neddylation, an ubiquitination-like, post-translational modification that
controls cell cycle and proliferation, is strongly associated with
cancer. Interestingly, we recently identified that glycyl-tRNA synthetase
(GlyRS) as a critical chaperone for neddylation1. GlyRS is also an
essential enzyme for protein synthesis, which is required for tumor
growth. Therefore, the dual functional GlyRS may be a novel target for
anti-cancer therapy. Consistent with this idea, we found strong positive
correlation between the level of GlyRS and tumor progression in breast
cancer. A proof-of-concept inhibitor of GlyRS for aminoacylation was able
to suppress neddylation in breast cancer cells, and reduce their lung
metastasis in a mouse model. Taken together, we propose that GlyRS is a
novel and promising target for cancer treatment.
