Title: Multiplex immunohistochemical staining of PD-L1, PD-1, CD3, CD4,
CD8, CD68, FoxP3, and Ki-67 and image analysis of tumor and invasive
margin in human FFPE NSCLC tissue.


Evaluating the density of immune cell subtypes and their relative spatial
positioning in cancers has become an important tool in understanding
response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The purpose of this study was
to investigate protein expression of PD-L1, PD-1, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68,
FoxP3, and Ki-67 with four multiplex immunohistochemical assays
(Ki-67+CD8, CD3+CD4+Ki-67, FoxP3+PD-1+CD8, and CD68+PD-L1+CD3) using DAB,
red, and green chromogens within formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded
non-small cell lung (NSCLC) tissues. The Ki-67+CD8 multiplex was
developed to evaluate the density of cytotoxic T cells and the percentage
that are proliferating. The CD3+CD4+Ki-67 multiplex characterizes the
frequency of CD4+ T cells and evaluate proliferation in this subset. The
FoxP3+PD-1+CD8 multiplex evaluates the regulatory T cell subset and
evaluates PD-1 expression. The CD68+PD-L1+CD3 multiplex characterizes
PD-L1 expression on macrophages and T cells. Cell densities were
evaluated in the center of tumor and invasive margin regions, and image
analysis was performed to quantitate each stain as a single agent and
co-expression within each multiplex assay.
