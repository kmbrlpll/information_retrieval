Title: Circulating cytokine levels predictive of Grade≥3 radiation
pneumonitis: Preliminary secondary analysis of a randomized controlled
trial of definitive chemoradiation in locally advanced NSCLC.


PURPOSE: Host immune activation is believed to be a major player of
radiation pneumonitis (RP). Several cytokine and angiogenic factors
(CAFs) have been studied as correlative markers and therapeutic targets
for RP; however, studies are sparse in the setting of prospective trials
and high-grade toxicity (Grade≥3) endpoints. We examined the predictive
value of several CAFs in combination with clinical factors for RP in the
context of a Phase II, prospective randomized study of intensity
modulated RT (IMRT) versus proton therapy for locally advanced NSCLC
(n=178) as well as a prospective laboratory cohort (n=43).

METHODS: From July 2009 to April 2014, 221 patients were treated with
proton therapy or IMRT to doses of 60-74 Gy equivalents with concurrent
platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Primary endpoints were symptomatic RP
(Grade≥2) and RP requiring intervention (Grade≥3). Plasma circulating
levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, IL-17, IL-2, IL-1β, and IL-1α were
measured at baseline and post-treatment (median time 48 days post-RT) by
multiplex electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Clinical characteristics
were evaluated for associations with Grade≥3 RP: histology, age,
smoking status, mean lung dose (MLD), chemotherapy, stage, performance
status, and RT technique. CAFs with >50% undetectable samples were
removed from analysis, and samples below the lower limit of quantitation
(LLQ) were transformed to the mean of zero and the LLQ. Predictive values
of clinical and cytokine factors were evaluated in univariate and
multivariate analyses via Cox proportional hazards modeling.

RESULTS: Of the 221 patients, 42 (19.0%) developed Grade 2 RP, and 22
(9.95%) developed Grade≥3 RP. Both IL-1α and IL-1β had >50% of
undetectable samples and were removed from analysis. Pre-treatment level
of IL-6 ≥4.00 pg/mL was associated with Grade≥3 RP (HR 2.487;
p=.048), as was post-treatment level of IL-10 ≥0.50 pg/mL (HR 2.931;
p=.020). On multivariate analysis, the factors associated with Grade≥3
RP development were post-treatment level of IL-10 ≥0.50 pg/mL (HR
3.332; p=.015) and MLD ≥20 Gy (HR 5.864; pRESULTS: Of the 221 patients,

CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary analysis of prospectively collected
CAFs, post-radiation IL-10 level was significantly associated with
Grade≥3 RP and, if validated, may serve as a predictor of this toxicity
in combination with MLD. IL-10 plays an important role in the
inflammatory response and is potentially targetable, warranting further
investigation.
