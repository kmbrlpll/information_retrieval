Title: CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide sgRNA libraries for loss-of-function and
gain-of-function genetic screens.


Genome-wide loss-of-function screening is a fundamental method to
identify genes responsible for driving biological processes. Complex
pooled lentiviral-based libraries expressing large numbers of genetic
disruptors, such as shRNAs (RNAi) or sgRNAs (CRISPR), make large-scale
cell screening practical. While RNAi-based approaches have proven to be
an effective strategy for these screens, recent work has showed
CRISPR-based technologies offer not only an effective alternative, but
distinct advantage. We will present unpublished data from genetic screens
in human cancer cell lines using CRISPR-Knockout (KO), CRISPRi and
CRISPRa technologies, as well as RNAi. Although loss-of-function shRNA
and sgRNA pooled library screens are similar in concept, the gene loss of
function is achieved by different mechanisms (mRNA degradation with RNAi,
full gene disruption with CRISPR-KO, transcriptional inhibition with
CRISPRi), so some divergences are expected and indeed observed when
comparing results obtained using one method versus the other.
Furthermore, contrary to RNAi, CRISPR technology can be modified to
activate gene expression (CRISPRa), thus enabling the use of genome-wide
gain-of-function screening in gene function studies.
