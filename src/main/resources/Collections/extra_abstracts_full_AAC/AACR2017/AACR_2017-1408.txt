Title: LIM protein Ajuba participates in the ATR response by direct
interaction with RPA70.


DNA damage response (DDR) pathways are essential for genome stability and
cell survival. Specifically, the ATR kinase is activated by DNA
replication stress or UV irradiation. An early event in this activation
is the phosphorylation and local recruitment of RPA, a single strand DNA
binding protein. Our lab has shown that the LIM protein Ajuba associates
with RPA, an OB fold-containing protein, and this interaction prevents an
unscheduled ATR response. We hypothesize that Ajuba represses the ATR
pathway through direct interaction with RPA, thereby preventing
activation of ATR. To test this hypothesis, we employed E. coli and in
vitro translation system for the production of recombinant proteins. Our
data show that Ajuba directly associates with the large subunit of RPA,
RPA70. The domains involved in the interaction were the C-terminal OB
folds of RPA70, and the region between the PreLIM and LIM domains in
Ajuba. We speculate that this interaction mediates the association of
Ajuba with the RPA complex in cells. Understanding the implication of the
Ajuba and RPA interaction will allow us to gain insights on the
regulation of DDR, which is involved in early events of cellular
transformation and tumorigenesis in human cells.
