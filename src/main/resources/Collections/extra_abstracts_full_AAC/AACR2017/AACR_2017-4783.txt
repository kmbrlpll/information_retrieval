Title: Regulation of GBM stemness and mesenchymal transition.


While growing evidence suggests that tumor microenvironment can modulate
stemness and the mesenchymal phenotype, little is known about how these
cell states are coordinately regulated. We report that S100A4 controls
both stemness and mesenchymal transition in GBM cells. In a spontaneous
mouse glioma model and in primary human GBM tumorspheres, S100A4
expression is enriched in tumor-initiating cells and is required for
self-renewal and tumor growth in vivo. In addition, greater than 80
percent of S100A4+ cells are associated with the tumor vasculature, a
known niche for glioma stem cells, and S100A4 promotes pro-angiogenic
factor expression. Interestingly, acidosis induces expression of S100A4
and the EMT regulators SNAIL1/2 and acidosis-induced EMT regulator
expression requires S100A4 function. Importantly, S100A4 functions as a
molecular switch between the proneural and mesenchymal states in GBM as
S100A4 knockdown results in down-regulation of the mesenchymal signature
genes, including the “master transcriptional regulators of mesenchymal
transition”, and concurrent up-regulation of proneural signature genes.
Together, these results indicate that S100A4 sits in a critical node in
the molecular network that controls both glioma stem cells and the
mesenchymal phenotype.
