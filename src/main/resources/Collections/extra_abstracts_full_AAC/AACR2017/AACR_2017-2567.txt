Title: CYP24A1-induced vitamin D insufficiency promotes breast cancer
growth.


Vitamin D plays a critical role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis
by regulating the expression of genes affecting cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis. The vitamin D 24-hydroxylase CYP24A1
functions in vitamin D target tissues to degrade the hormonal form of
vitamin D. Existing knowledge regarding dysregulated CYP24A1 expression
supports its candidacy as a putative oncogene. In our presentation, we
demonstrate that the suppression of constitutive CYP24A1 expression by
CYP24A1-specidic shRNA conferred target cells with increased
susceptibility to apoptosis and consequently inhibited
anchorage-independent growth in breast carcinoma cells. In addition,
suppression of vitamin D metabolism following knockdown of CYP24A1
significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. Since these data provide
substantial evidence for a pro-survival and stimulatory oncogenic effect
of CYP24A1 in breast carcinoma cells, we will discuss the potential
feasibility of CYP24A1-inhibitory cancer therapies.
