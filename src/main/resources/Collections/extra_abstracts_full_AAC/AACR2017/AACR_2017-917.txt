Title: CD82/KAI1 maintains the dormancy of long-term hematopoietic stem
cells through interaction with DARC-expressing macrophages.


Hematopoiesis is regulated by crosstalk between long-term repopulating
hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and supporting niche cells in the bone
marrow (BM). Here, we examine the role of CD82/KAI1 (CD82 hereafter) in
niche-mediated LT-HSC maintenance. We found that CD82 is expressed
predominantly on LT-HSCs and rarely on other hematopoietic
stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). In Cd82-/- mice, LT-HSCs were selectively
lost as they exited from quiescence and differentiated. Mechanistically,
CD82-based TGF-b1/Smad3 signaling leads to induction of CDK inhibitors
and cell-cycle inhibition. The CD82 binding partner DARC/CD234 is
expressed on macrophages and stabilizes CD82 on LT-HSCs, promoting their
quiescence. When DARC+ BM macrophages were ablated, the level of surface
CD82 on LT-HSCs decreased, leading to cell-cycle entry, proliferation,
and differentiation. A similar interaction appears to be relevant for
human HSPCs. Thus, CD82 is a functional surface marker of LT-HSCs that
maintains quiescence through interaction with DARC-expressing macrophages
in the BM stem cell niche. Finally, we hope that further development of
our study will allow us to improve leukemia treatment by awakening not
only “good” stem cells to keep beneficial stem cell functions, but
also “bad” stem cells (e.g. cancer stem cells) in order to increase
the sensitivity to treatment and avoid relapse.
