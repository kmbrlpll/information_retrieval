Title: Role of tissue stiffness and oxygen tension in promoting breast
cancer stem cells.


Breast tumors are stiff and hypoxic. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how
stiff and hypoxic conditions within the tumor microenvironment promote
breast cancer progression. Using an innovative engineered culture model
to recapitulate these features, we found that, under stiff and hypoxic
conditions, breast cancer cells have enhanced integrin-linked kinase
(ILK) expression and acquire cancer stem cell (CSC)-like traits,
suggesting tissue stiffness and oxygen tension can modulate ILK
expression to induce breast CSC formation. Knocking down ILK impairs the
mechanosensing of invasive breast cancer cells on stiff
microenvironments, inhibits CSC markers and properties. In contrast,
ectopic expression of ILK promotes breast CSC formation. In addition to
promoting CSC-like phenotype, microarray analysis reveals that stiff and
hypoxic microenvironments also regulate genes involved in mRNA
processing, splicing and the spliceosome. These data suggest that the
non-cellular compartment of the tumor microenvironment, namely tissue
mechanics and oxygen tension, can promote breast cancer progression by
controlling mechanotransduction and post-transcriptional regulation of
breast cancer cells.
