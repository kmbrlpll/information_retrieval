Title: Development of a novel antibody-drug conjugate targeting
endosialin/TEM-1: potent antitumor activity in sarcoma.


The TEM-1/Endosialin/CD248 receptor is expressed in the cell surface of
tumor-associated stroma cells, as well as in sarcoma and neuroblastoma
cells. This receptor is emerging as an attractive molecule in diagnostics
and therapeutics because of its expression across the stroma of many
human tumors, the low to absent expression in normal tissues and
accessibility from the vascular circulation. In this study, we present
evidence of the preclinical efficacy of a novel Antibody-Drug Conjugate
(ADC). It consists of a humanized TEM-1 monoclonal antibody (E.8-3)
conjugated to a highly potent payload (TEM-1-ADC). In TEM-1 expressing
cancer cell lines, this TEM-1-ADC demonstrated a powerful, specific and
target-dependent killing activity. High expression levels of TEM-1 in
cells correlated with efficient internalization, efficacy, and cytotoxic
effects in vitro. Efficacy studies demonstrated that TEM-1-ADC treatment
leads to a long lasting tumor growth inhibition of cell line-based models
of human sarcoma. Taken together, our results demonstrated that TEM-1 is
an attractive target in sarcoma and suggest that TEM-1-ADC has the
potential to be developed into a biotherapeutic agent in these
malignancies.
