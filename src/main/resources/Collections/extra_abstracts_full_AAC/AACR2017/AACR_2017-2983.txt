Title: Tumor induced stromal STAT1 deregulates mammary tissue homeostasis
and accelerates breast cancer.


The tumor microenvironment (TME) – the dynamic tissue space in which
the tumor exists – plays a significant role in tumor initiation and is
a key contributor in cancer progression. Little is known about the
tumor-induced changes in the adjacent tissue stroma. Herein, we sought to
explore tumor-induced changes in the TME at the morphological and
molecular level to further characterize cancer progression. We show that
tumor-adjacent mammary glands (TAGs) display altered branch morphology,
increased expression of αSMA particularly in myofibroblasts, and an
increased capacity to form mammospheres in 2D suspension culture. FACS
analysis showed that TAGs contain an increased number of Lin-CD24+/CD49+
enriched mammary gland stem cell (MaSCs) population, suggesting
deregulated tissue homeostasis in TAGs. We conducted comparative
transcriptomics on TAGs and contralateral control glands. Meta-analysis
on differentially expressed genes from our RNA-seq dataset plus two
breast cancer stromal patient microarray datasets identified shared
upregulation of STAT1, which we verified in tumor-adjacent tissues.
Knockdown of STAT1 in caveolin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(CAFs) cocultured with human breast cancer cells altered cancer cell
proliferation, further suggesting the role of STAT1 as a stromal
contributor of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in our proof-of-concept in
vivo experiment, co-treatment with fludarabine, a FDA-approved STAT1
activation inhibitor and DNA synthesis inhibitor, in combination with
doxorubicin, showed enhanced therapeutic efficacy in treating mouse
mammary gland tumors. Our results demonstrate that stromal STAT1
expression could promote tumor progression and is a potential therapeutic
target for breast cancer.
