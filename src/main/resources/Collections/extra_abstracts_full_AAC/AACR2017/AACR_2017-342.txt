Title: WHSC1L1-mediated EGFR mono-methylation enhances the cytoplasmic
and nuclear oncogenic activity of EGFR in head and neck cancer.


While multiple post-translational modifications have been reported to
regulate the function of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the
effect of protein methylation on its function has not been well
characterized. In this study, we show that WHSC1L1 mono-methylates lysine
721 in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, and that this methylation
leads to enhanced activation of its downstream ERK cascade without EGF
stimulation. We also show that EGFR K721 mono-methylation not only
affects the function of cytoplasmic EGFR, but also that of nuclear EGFR.
WHSC1L1-mediated methylation of EGFR in the nucleus enhanced its
interaction with PCNA in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
(SCCHN) cells and resulted in enhanced DNA synthesis and cell cycle
progression. Overall, our study demonstrates the multifaceted oncogenic
function of the protein lysine methyltransferase WHSC1L1 in SCCHN, which
is mediated through direct non-histone methylation of the EGFR protein
with effects both in its cytoplasmic and nuclear functions.
