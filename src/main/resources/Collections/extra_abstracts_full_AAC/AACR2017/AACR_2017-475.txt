Title: Role of microRNA-34a in regulating oncoprotein STMN1.


MicroRNAs, as negative regulators of gene expression, play a major role
in cellular homeostasis. Downregulation of miRs is common in cancer which
results in upregulation of multiple oncogenes in cancer. Here we show
that stathmin (STMN1), which is over-expressed and oncogenic in wide
variety of cancers, is regulated by microRNA-34 in prostate cancer.
Earlier studies suggest that stathmin is involved in vital cellular
processes such as cell proliferation, motility and metastasis. In the
present study, we show elevated expression of stathmin in metastatic
prostate cancer. Functionally, knockdown of stathmin in prostate cancer
cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, and
tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. We also show that tumor suppressor
microRNA miR-34a targets stathmin and mir-34 is regulated by
transcriptional corepressor CtBP1 (C-Terminal Binding Protein 1).
Further, Microarray analyses using stathmin modulated prostate cancer
cell line RNA revealed multiple molecular alterations which may play a
critical role in STMN1-mediated oncogenic activity. Thus, our study
suggests that CtBP1-regulated miR-34a modulates stathmin expression in
prostate cancer. This study therefore demonstrates functional role of
CtBP1-miR-34a-Stathmin axis in prostate cancer progression.
