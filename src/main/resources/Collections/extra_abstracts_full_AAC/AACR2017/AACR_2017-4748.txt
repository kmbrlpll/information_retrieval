Title: Novel predictive biomarker for monitoring adverse reactions to
radiation therapy.


Introduction: Radiation treatment is required by 70% of cancer patients,
however there is currently no clinical method for determining the
therapeutic response or radiation induced toxicity that can be used
during a course of radiation therapy to personalize the dose for
individual patients. The only standard method is CT/PET and/or MRI. This
is a major clinical concern for radiation oncologists with so many new
agents being approved in combination with radiation therapy.

Methodology: Herein we describe a highly sensitive clinically validated
assay that measures the extent of normal tissue damage induced by
radiation by quantitation of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) derived from
cellular apoptosis detected in plasma of patients undergoing radiation
therapy. The assay employs DNA capture probes and SuperbDNATM signal
amplification technology with alkaline phosphatase labelled signaling
probes coupled with dioxetane phosphate chemiluminescence detection. The
assay can be performed directly on patient plasma samples and can be
readily automated.

Conclusion: RadTox TM can be used both for research and clinical testing
of plasma samples for patients undergoing radiation therapy for
optimization and personalization of treatment.
