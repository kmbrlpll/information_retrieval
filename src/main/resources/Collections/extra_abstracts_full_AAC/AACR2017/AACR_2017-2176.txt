Title: Thymoquinone synergizes the anticancer properties of cisplatin
against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and protects normal oral
epithelial cells.


Cisplatin (CDDP) is potent anticancer agent different tumors such as head
and neck cancers. Thymoquinone is natural compound drawing attention as
chemotherapeutic and chemomodulator. Herein, we studied the
chemomodulatory effect of thymoquinone to CDDP against squamous cell
carcinoma cells. CDDP killed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells
(UMSCC-14C) with IC50’s of 5.2±0.2, 2.6±0.2 and 1.6±0.1 µM after
treatment for 24h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively. On the other hand,
IC50’s of CDDP against normal oral epithelial cells were 36.4±1.1,
16.3±0.6 and 6.7±1.1 µM after exposure for 24h, 48 h and 72 h,
respectively. Thymoquinone alone exerted considerable cytotoxicity
against UMSCC-14C cells with IC50’s of 9.0±0.2, 6.9±0.1 and 5.0±0.2
µM after treatment for 24h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively. While
significantly weaker killing effect was noticed for thymoquinone against
normal oral epithelial cells (OEC) with IC50’s of 41.1±0.5,
36.6±1.1and 26.3±1.2µM after exposure for 24h, 48 h and 72 h,
respectively. Equitoxic combination of thymoquinone and CDDP showed
synergistic interaction against UMSCC-14C cells (Combination index of
0.58) and antagonistic interaction against OEC cells (Combination index
of 1.12). Using annexin-V/PI staining, it was found that thymoquinone
alone (5 µM) increased apoptotic cell fraction in UMSCC-14C cells, as
early as after only 6 hours, from 1.7±0.1% to 24.4±0.6% compared to
2.7±0.04 apoptosis induced by CDDP (5 µM). Combination of CDDP with
thymoquinone further increased total apoptosis in UMSCC-14C to 32.9±1.5%
after 6 h. prolonged exposure of UMSCC-14C to thymoquinone (5 µM) alone
for 24 h resulted in 96.7±1.6% total apoptosis which was increased after
combination with CDDP to 99.3±1.2% in UMSCC-14C cells. In contrast to
UMSCC-14C cells, thymoquinone did not induce any significant apoptosis in
OEC and even decreased apoptosis induced by CDDP alone from 4.5±0.3% to
3.4±0.2% after combination for 24 h. Using western blot analysis,
neither thymoquinone nor CDDP managed to increase the expression level of
p53 apoptotic protein; while combination of CDDP with thymoquinone
significantly increased p53 expression by 4.5 folds. On the other hand,
both CDDP and thymoquinone decreased the expression level of the
anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 to be 60% and 20% of control level,
respectively. Combination of both agents further abolished the level of
Bcl-2 to be 10% of control level. Caspase-9 expression was similarly
induced by 2 folds and 4.5 folds after treatment with CDDP and
thymoquinone, respectively. Combination of CDDP and thymoquinone further
induced the level of caspase-9 to be 6 folds original basal expression
level. None of these finding could be detected in normal OEC cell line.
In conclusion, thymoquinone synergize the anticancer properties of CDDP
against squamous cell carcinoma cells and protects from its damaging
effect against normal epithelial cells
