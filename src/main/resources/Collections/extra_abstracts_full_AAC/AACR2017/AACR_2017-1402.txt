Title: NME3 links mitochondrial fusion to DNA repair in nuclear genome.


In mammals, there are 10 isoforms of NME (NDP Kinase), which catalyze the
reversible reaction of NTPs formation from NDP and ATP. By RNA
interference, NME3 was found critical for DNA repair. Data from analysis
of the steady-state levels of rNTPs and dNTPs suggest that NME3 does not
play a critical role in determining the total pools of these nucleotides.
However, its mitochondrial localization and catalytic function are
necessary for its function in DNA repair. Super-resolution microscopy
analysis indicates the localization of NME3 at mitochondrial outer
membrane. We further used APEX-mediated biotinylation to identify
proteins interacting with NME3. Among them, Mfn1 is validated to
associate with mitochondrial NME3 in vitro and in vivo. We provide
evidence that NME3 is required for DNA damage-induced mitochondria fusion
via GTP-mediated fueling of Mfn1. The lack of this process increased
nucleotide oxidation and sustained DNA damage in nuclear genome. These
data highlight the function of NME3 in mitochondrial fusion, which is
required for the maintenance of genome integrity.
