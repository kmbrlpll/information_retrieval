Title: Genetic reclassification of prostate-specific antigen levels for
personalized prostate cancer screening.


Background: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer
results missed diagnoses as well as many unnecessary biopsies and their
associated morbidities. Because PSA levels are heritable, traditional PSA
screening may be improved by adjustment for constitutive germline
genetics that influence PSA independently of prostate cancer.

Methods: In a previous genome-wide association study in non-Hispanic
white men without prostate cancer in the Kaiser Permanente Research
Program on Genes, Environment and Health cohort, we identified 40 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) independently and significantly associated
with PSA levels. Among them, 24 were not associated with prostate cancer
risk. To calculate genetically normalized PSA (i.e., PSA’), we
multiplied each man’s most recent PSA measurement by a factor that
adjusted for the amount by which his 24 PSA-specific SNPs may have
increased his PSA level. We then compared how men without prostate cancer
were classified based on their PSA and PSA’ levels with regard to
decisions for diagnostic testing.

Results: PSA and PSA’ were highly correlated among non-Hispanic white
men without prostate cancer (r2: 0.959; 95% CI: 0.958-0.960). Still, 4.6%
were reclassified from above to below a cutpoint of 2.5 ng/ml when using
the PSA’ measure, and 2.7% were reclassified from below to above this
cutpoint (4.6% - 2.7% = 1.9% net reclassified to below the cutoff). The
reclassification was even more pronounced when restricting to controls
with a negative prostate biopsy: 5.0% downward and 1.5% upward (3.5% net
reclassified to below the cutoff).

Conclusions: Normalizing PSA levels using germline PSA variants may
reduce the number of subjects without prostate cancer receiving
unnecessary biopsies.
