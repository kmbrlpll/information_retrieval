Title: Src regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
(PPARγ) in lipid metabolism of lung cancer.


Metabolic reprogramming, recently becoming one of the cancer hallmarks,
is linked to oncogenic signal transduction to find a better solution for
cancer therapy. As one of key mediators in oncogenic signal transduction,
non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src is known to drive cancer progression by
promoting cell proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance. Although
previous studies reported that Src promotes fat accumulation and
suppresses browning of white adipocytes, little is known about the
mechanistic role of Src in cancer metabolism. Here we report that Src
mediates lipid mobilization by suppressing transcriptional activity of
PPARγ, a key regulator of lipid metabolism. Firstly, we found Src
suppression of PPARγ activity which, interestingly, turned out to be
independent of Src kinase domain or a known Src phosphorylation site of
PPARγ at tyrosine 78. Since the treatment of Src inhibitor (e.g.,
SU6656, PP2) could rescue Src-driven PPARγ suppression by possibly
changing Src conformation, we might suggest the involvement of Src-PPARγ
interaction in the regulatory mechanism. Mechanistically, further in
vitro experiment showed Src inhibitor treatment recovered expression of
PPARγ target genes such as fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) and
cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) in a subset of non-small cell lung
cancer cell lines. The increase of FABP4 and CD36 expression was
associated with the reduction of lipid droplets, suggesting the role of
Src regulation of PPARγ in lipid mobilization. Collectively, this
finding provides better understandings about the role of Src in cancer
lipid metabolism, and an insight into therapeutic combination of
targeting oncogenic signal transduction and lipid metabolism to treat
cancer.
