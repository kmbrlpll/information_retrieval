Title: Heparan sulfate proteoglycans as novel target in cancer precise
therapy.


Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have crucial regulatory roles in
tumor onset and progression. HSPGs

are composed of a core protein and glycan chains characterized by
repeated disaccharide units which can

be sulfated at different amount and position. HSPG have enormous
structural diversity due to the different

possible modifications of the single saccharide units within the
polysaccharide, such as position, sulphation

and acetylation. As a result HSPG can bind and modulate their binding to
signaling molecules such as

growth factors, morphogens and chemokines1 .

HSPG proved to be important in mediating cancer development and
progression by enhancing the binding

of growth factors, morphogens and cytokines to their cognate receptors,
thus activating signaling pathways

that give rise to angiogensis, cell growth and proliferation, together
with invasion and metastasis 2-3.

NT4 is a branched peptides that targets HSPGs. NT4 specifically binds to
sulfated glycosaminoglycans on

cancer cells and tissues. NT4 can be conjugated to many different
cytotoxic units and tracers. NT4

conjugated to paclitaxel produced tumor regression in a breast cancer
orthotopic mouse model 4. NT4

conjugated to tracers can discriminate between tumor and healthy tissue
in different human cancer

specimen5.

We will show the ability of NT4 to drive tracers onto tumor lesions by
means of Qdots and in vivo imaging,

proving their promising features as theranostics. We will also show NT4
ability to interfere with HSPG-

modulated activities such as: tumor cell proliferation, migration and
invasion of matrix; as well as

endothelial cells proliferation, migration and tube formation. NT4-HSPG
interactions and consequent

modulation of signaling pathways will prove the importance of this
versatile tool, NT4, in addressing tumor

cells and interfering in their cell-cell and cell-matrix communications.
