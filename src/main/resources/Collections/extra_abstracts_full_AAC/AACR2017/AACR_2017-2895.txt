Title: Octamer-4/microRNA-1246 signaling axis drives Wnt/β-catenin
activation in liver cancer stem cells.


Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the main type of liver cancer in human,
is one of the most prevalent and deadly malignancies in the world.
Despite advances in therapy, prognosis remains dismal, largely attributed
by our limited understanding on information related to the progressive
development of the disease, particularly in their cancer-initiating and
stem cell-like properties. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated in CD133
liver cancer stem cells (CSC), a subset of cells known to be a root of
tumor recurrence and therapy resistance in HCC. However, the regulatory
mechanism of this pathway in CSCs remains unclear. Here, we show that
human miRNA, miR-1246, promotes cancer stemness including self-renewal,
drug resistance, tumorigencity and metastasis by activation of
Wnt/β-catenin pathway via suppressing the expression of AXIN2 and
GSK3β, two key members of the β-catenin destruction complex. This
observation was validated by both in vitro and in vivo functional / cell
biological studies on HCC cell lines with or without miR-1246 expression
modulated by lentiviral based knockdown and overexpression strategies as
well as in miR-1246 repressed HCC cells with concomitant expression of
wild-type or constitutively active β-catenin. Clinically, high
endogenous and circulating miR-1246 was identified in HCC clinical
samples and correlated with a worse prognosis. Further functional
analysis identified Oct4 to be the direct upstream regulator of miR-1246,
which cooperatively drive β-catenin activation in liver CSCs. In
conclusion, our findings not only uncover the non-canonical regulation of
Wnt/β-catenin in liver CSCs by Oct4/miR-1246 signaling axis, but also
provide a novel diagnostic marker as well as therapeutic intervention for
HCC.
