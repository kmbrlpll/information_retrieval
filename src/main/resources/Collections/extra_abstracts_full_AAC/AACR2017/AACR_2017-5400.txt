Title: Accurate identification of single nucleotide variants in whole
genome amplified single cells.


Single cell sequencing for analyzing DNA mutations across the genome in
somatic tissues is critically important for studying development, cancer
and aging. However, current procedures are prone to artifacts and to date
a reliable protocol for single-cell somatic mutation analysis remains to
be developed. Here we address the two largest sources of artifacts, i.e.,
DNA denaturation-related cytosine deamination and allelic bias-driven
whole genome amplification errors. We first reconfigured multiple
displacement amplification (MDA) into an efficient protocol for whole
genome amplification of single cells without cytosine deamination
artifacts, i.e., Single Cell MDA (SCMDA). We then developed a new
single-cell SNV caller (SCcaller) that distinguishes real somatic
mutations and amplification errors by utilizing a SNP-based localized
estimate of allelic amplification bias. The procedure was validated by
comparing SCMDA-amplified single cells with unamplified clones derived
from single cells from the same population. Together with SCcaller, SCMDA
provides a firm foundation for analyzing cellular heterogeneity in
somatic mutational landscapes in tumor and surrounding, normal tissues.
