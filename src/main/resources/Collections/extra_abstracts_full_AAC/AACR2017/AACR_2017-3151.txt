Title: Loss of Axin1 drives acquired resistance to WNT pathway blockade
in colorectal cancer cells carrying RSPO3 fusions.


In colorectal cancer (CRC), WNT pathway activation by genetic
rearrangements of RSPO3 is emerging as a promising target. However, its
low prevalence severely limits availability of preclinical models for
in-depth characterization. Using a pipeline designed to suppress
stroma-derived signal, we find that RSPO3 “outlier” expression in CRC
samples highlights translocation and fusion transcript expression.
Outlier search in 151 CRC cell lines identified VACO6 and SNU1411cells as
carriers of, respectively, a canonical PTPRK(e1)-RSPO3(e2) fusion and a
novel PTPRK(e13)-RSPO3(e2) fusion. Both lines displayed marked in vitro
and in vivo sensitivity to WNT blockade by the porcupine inhibitor
LGK974, associated with transcriptional and morphological evidences of
WNT pathway suppression. Long-term treatment of VACO6 cells with LGK974
led to the emergence of a resistant population carrying two frameshift
deletions of the WNT pathway inhibitor AXIN1, with consequent protein
loss. Suppression of AXIN1 in parental VACO6 cells by RNA interference
conferred marked resistance to LGK974. These results provide the first
mechanism of secondary resistance to WNT pathway inhibition.
