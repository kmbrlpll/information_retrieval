Title: Choline metabolism in cancer cells modifies PD-L1 expression.


Increased expression of choline kinase-α (Chk-α), the enzyme that
converts choline to phosphocholine has been observed in most cancer cells
including breast (1). This increase of choline kinase results in
increased production of phosphocholine that is used in the synthesis of
membrane phosphatidylcholine. We investigated the relationship between
Chk-α and the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in triple
negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Expression of PD-L1 in
response to the secretion of interferon gamma (IFNγ) by cytotoxic T
cells and its binding to the immune checkpoint PD-1 on T cells results in
cancer cells escaping destruction by the immune system (2). Quantitative
real-time PCR analysis (q-RT-PCR) did not reveal any change in PD-L1 mRNA
expression between MDA-MB-231 expressing an empty vector control plasmid
(231-EV) and MDA-MB-23 stably expressing shRNA against Chk (231-Chk).
However, there was a difference in the mean intensity fluorescence (MIF)
between 231-EV (325 ±11.5, n=2) and 231-Chk (527±18.5, n=2) in the FACS
analysis. Upon induction with IFNγ (10ng/ml) for 24h, there was 1.23
fold increase in PD-L1 mRNA in 231-Chk compared to 231-EV. Interestingly,
the MIP for cell surface expression of PD-L1 was 600±21 (n=2) for 231-EV
compared to 872±16 (n=2) for 231-Chk cells. Values represent mean + SE.
These data suggest that the cell surface increase of PD-L1 in 231-Chk
cells could be due to translocation. Increased PD-L1 expression creates
an opportunity to deliver PD-L1 targeted nanoparticles carrying
therapeutic cargo. Since most conventional treatments result in a
decrease of Chk-α and phosphocholine, our data suggest that these
treatments may also result in cancer cells escaping immune surveillance
through expression of PD-L1.
