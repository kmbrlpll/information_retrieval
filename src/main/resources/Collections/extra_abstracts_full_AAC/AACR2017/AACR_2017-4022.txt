Title: Validation of label-free impedance analysis as a versatile tool
for cancer molecular therapeutics screening.


In vitro monitoring cancer cells response to treatment often involves
laborious sample processing and collects single data points that are
against the dynamic nature of cancer cells. Here we present the
adaptation of an impedance-based methodology to dynamically monitor
cancer cell behavior and therapeutic response. The technology detects
cell death, proliferation or migration by measuring changes in
conductance of microelectrodes embedded in 96 and 384-wells cell culture
plates. It avoids sample labeling and processing and allows continuous
monitoring of cell response. Our data shows validation with cancer cell
lines and primary cells monitored for cell invasion/migration, anticancer
drug response and receptor signaling activation, with similar results
over end point assays. Easy experiment set up and minimal sample
processing make the technology ideal for applications in large screening
campaigns, while label-free technology allows further analysis on the
same samples through orthogonal assays.
