Title: Probing the roles of SUMOylation in cancer cell biology using a
selective SUMO activating enzyme inhibitor.


SUMOylation has been implicated in many cellular processes that are
important for cancer cell survival, including cell cycle, chromosome
structure and segregation, nuclear and subnuclear organization,
transcription and DNA damage repair. However, a potent and selective
inhibitor to target the SUMO pathway has been lacking. The
SUMO-activating enzyme (SAE) is an essential enzyme in the pathway that
initiates the SUMOylation process. Here we report the identification of
the first mechanism-based SAE inhibitors with nanomolar potency in
cellular assays. These inhibitors selectively block SAE enzyme activity
and total SUMOylation in cells, which leads to reduced cancer cell
proliferation. Moreover, SAE inhibition resulted in disruption of PML
nuclear bodies and redistribution of DAXX. In vivo administration of SAE
inhibitor into tumor bearing mice results in modulation of several
biomarkers including a significant reduction in SUMO-conjugates and E2
Ubc9 thioesters, demonstrating SUMO pathway inhibition. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of inhibiting the SUMO pathway with small
molecule inhibitors and provide tools to study the SUMO biology in cancer.
