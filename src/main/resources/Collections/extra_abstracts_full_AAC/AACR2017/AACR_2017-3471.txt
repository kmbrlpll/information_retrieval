Title: Replication of megabase-size alpha-satellite DNA arrays in human
centromere.


Alphoid centromere array is composed by 171 bp AT rich alphoid monomer
that tandemly arranged into high order repeat unit up to 4 MB array.
Hallmark of centromeric DNA is CENPB box, a 17 bp motif that is a binding
site of CENPB. As the chromosomal site that regulates the precise and
accurate chromosome segregation, understanding DNA replication in
centromere will reveal insight into faithful chromosome segregation that
potentially influence cellular behavior in normal and cancer cell. The
present of active replicons within alphoid centromere array are detected
by enrichment of nsDNA abundance. This finding is supported by evident of
Orc2, Cdt1 and Treslin accumulation on the alphoid centromere array.
Chromatin fiber analysis revealed that inter origin distance within
alphoid centromere array is irregular. CENPB depletion that is affected
centromeric chromatin structure enhances DNA replication activity within
alphoid centromeric array, indicates centromeric chromatin landscape
alteration affected centromeric DNA replication dynamic.
