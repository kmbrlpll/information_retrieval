Title: Deterring breast cancer progression. The critical role of a
lipid-sphingolipid epigenetic mechanism of cell fate.


Genetic and environmental factors cooperate to assure precise genome-wide
epigenetic regulation of the mammary epithelia cell transcriptome. Our
interest in regulatory epigenetic mechanisms that, by determining mammary
epithelial cell decisions, are pivotal to deter the onset and progression
of breast cancer, let us identify a regulatory epigenetic mechanism of
mammary morphogenesis that links a physiological regulatory lipid of
environmental origin (all-trans retinoic acid, RA) with sphingolipids
capable of determining either cell death (ceramide, CER) or cell life
(sphingosine 1 phosphate, S1P).

Whenever RA, for different reasons, fails to perform the epigenetic
transcriptional control of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2/SMDP3),
involved in the synthesis of pro-apoptotic CER, S1P fosters both
pro-proliferative and pro-invasive activity. Apparently, in the absence
of epigenetic control of CER production by RA, S1P contributes to
determine RA tumorigenic action. This study provides the rationale for
combination therapeutic approaches with epigenetic drugs and inhibitors
of either sphingosine kinase, the enzyme involved in S1P synthesis, or
S1P receptors.

This study was supported by the NCI R01 CA127614 grant (NS).
