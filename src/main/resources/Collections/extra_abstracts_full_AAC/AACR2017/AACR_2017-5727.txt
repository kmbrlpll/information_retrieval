Title: A functional polymorphism in DTX1 gene of Notch pathway predicts
the prognosis of surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer.


Notch signaling pathway has been implicated in the prognosis of non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study was conducted to determine the
association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Notch
pathway genes and survival outcomes of surgically resected NSCLC. Among
the 64 SNPs analyzed in the discovery set, 8 SNPs were significantly
associated with overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS).
Among the 8 SNPs, the association was consistently observed only for DTX1
rs1732786A>G in the validation sets. In combined analysis, the
rs1732786A>G was significantly associated with better OS and DFS
(adjusted HR aHR for OS, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95; P = 0.01; aHR for DFS,
0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.94; P = 0.003; under codominant model). To verify
the functional relevance of the rs1732786A>G in DTX1 promoter region, we
conducted dual-luciferase reporter assays. The G allele showed
significantly higher luciferase activity than the A allele (P G
polymorphism may affect DTX1 expression and may be a useful marker for
predicting the prognosis of patients with early stage NSCLC.
