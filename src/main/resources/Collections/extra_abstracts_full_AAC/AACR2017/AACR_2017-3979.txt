Title: Immune correlates of pathologic response in bladder cancer
patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.


Introduction and Objective: The immune system is increasingly recognized
as both a key player in cancer control and as druggable target. We
hypothesized that the immune system impacts pathologic response in
patients undergoing cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for
muscle-invasive bladder cancer though the immune system.

Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on tumor DNA from
patients in two independent cohorts who underwent cisplatin-based NAC.
The Memorial Sloan Kettering/Dana Farber Cancer Institute (n=50; 25
responders) and Philadelphia cohorts (n=48; 20 responders) were treated
with gemcitabine / cisplatin or methotrexate / vinblastine / doxorubicin
/ cisplatin. Mutation analysis was performed using standard analytical
pipelines. Macrohistocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted neoantigens
were identified with netMHCpan and PolySolver. High affinity neoantigens
were defined to have ≤500 nM binding affinity (Kd). Pathologic response
was defined as ≤ypTis cystectomy specimen. CIBERSORT was used to infer
immune cell infiltrate based on DASL Illumina microarray expression
profiles (n=41; 17 responders).

Results: Chemoresponders had >twice as many putative neoantigens as
nonresponders (471 vs 207 neoantigens respectively; p=1x10-6, Wilcoxon).
This relationship maintained significance when neoantigens were limited
to Kd≤100 nM or ≤50 nM, and when chemoresponse was defined as
ypT0-only, or ≤ypT1. ERCC2 loss-of-function mutations were 36%
sensitive in identifying chemoresponders but 96% specific. Above-median
neoantigen burden was 81% sensitive in identifying chemoresponders and
78% specific. CD8+ cells were enriched in responders (13.5% vs 8.4% of
infiltrate; pResults: Chemoresponders had >twice as many putative
neoantigens as nonresponders (471 vs 207 neoantigens respectively;
p=1x10-6, Wilcoxon). This relationship maintained significance when
neoantigens were limited to Kd≤100 nM or ≤50 nM, and when
chemoresponse was defined as ypT0-only, or ≤ypT1. ERCC2
loss-of-function mutations were 36% sensitive in identifying
chemoresponders but 96% specific. Above-median neoantigen burden was 81%
sensitive in identifying chemoresponders and 78% specific. CD8+ cells
were enriched in responders (13.5% vs 8.4% of infiltrate; p<0.008,
t-test) as were activated NK cells (15.5% vs 12.7%; p=0.05). In 28
samples where WES and CIBERSORT data was available, the neoantigen burden
was correlated to the CD8+ infiltrate value (R2=0.33, Pearson).

Conclusions: Neoantigen burden and CD8+ infiltrate correlate strongly
with chemoresponse. Neoantigen burden and CD8+ infiltrate are directly
proportional. NAC may therefore exert known tumor cell autonomous effects
and an extrinsic effect involving the immune system via neoantigens.
Anti-neoantigen responses have been shown to impact immune checkpoint
responses and a similar mechanism may mediate cytotoxic chemoresponse.
Experiments are underway to directly and functionally characterize the
effect of the immune system in chemoresponse.
