Title: Inhibition of DNA repair by NR1D1 enhances chemosensitivity of
breast cancer cells.


Most chemotherapeutic agents exert cytotoxic effects by inducing
excessive DNA lesions in cancer cells. Therefore, regulating DNA repair
networks is a critical factor that determines sensitivity of cancer cells
to chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we identified the role of
nuclear receptor NR1D1 in DNA repair, which enhanced chemosensitivity in
breast cancer cells. NR1D1 inhibited recruitment of the DNA repair
complex to damaged DNA sites, thereby impaired proper DNA repair upon
doxorubicin treatment in breast cancer cells. Interaction with
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and subsequent PARylation were critical
steps that allow NR1D1 to translocate to DNA double-strand breaks. In
agreement, depletion of NR1D1 in MCF-7 cells resulted in resistance to a
chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin, in both in vitro and in vivo
experiments. Further, NR1D1 expression level was correlated positively
with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients who received
chemotherapy. Thus, NR1D1 and its ligands may provide better therapeutic
options that could enhance the outcomes of adjuvant chemotherapy in
breast cancer patients.
