Title: Unified theoretical algorithms for graphics dynamic multiple
transformations of dose-effect relationships with computer simulation.


Based on physico-chemical principle of the mass-action law, bio-system
analysis (arrangement & combinatorial) several hundred rate equations
have been derived and published. Mathematical induction allows the
deduction of them into the unified general median-effect equation (MEE)
that makes dose & effect “interchangeable” for the 1st order and
higher order dynamics. Based on the MEE plot, all dose-effect curves can
be “linealized” which allows the quantitative determination of
x-intercept (log Dm which signifies potency) and slope (m which signifies
shape or dynamic order). Extension of MEE to multi-drug combinations
resulted the combination index (CI) theorem which quantifies synergism
(CI1). This unprecedented approach and multi-step logics have been
summarized in [Chou TC. Pharmacol Rev 58: 621-681, 2006] which has been
cited 1,261 times in 485 bio-medical journals
(http://www.researcherid.com/rid/B4111-2009 as of 10.19.2016).
Dose-effect curves (single & multi-drugs) can be quantitatively
transformed into the MEE plot, Fa-CI plot, isobologram, Fa-DRI Plot for
dose-reduction index, and when n>2, the polygonogram. This presentation
will illustrate of combinations (1:5) of docetaxel (TXT) with T-compound
against HCT-116 colon carcinoma xenograft in nude mice. In all, only 66
nude mice have been used, i.e. TXT 3 doses, T 3 doses and TXT+T 4 doses,
plus a control group, each N=6. The MEE “Linearization” allows the
“Econo-Green Bio-research”, with small experimental size and small
number of data points, using small number of animals. The algorithms
based computer simulation using CompuSyn software can be completed within
one second after the dose and effect data entries. The CompuSyn has been
offered for free download upon registration via www.combosyn.com.
