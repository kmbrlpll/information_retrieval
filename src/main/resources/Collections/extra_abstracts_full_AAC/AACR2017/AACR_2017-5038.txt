Title: Comparison of the dose response of malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumor in vitro growth inhibition of 30 drugs to reported Cmax
values.


In this study we aim to identify drugs that can be repurposed to inhibit
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a rare and deadly
sarcoma associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Inhibition of
MPNST cell growth in vitro was tested for 30 drugs that have previously
been through human clinical trials such that the maximum concentration of
compound in human serum (Cmax) at the maximum tolerated dose has been
determined. Drugs were compared to the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin. Six
MPNST cell lines from human and mouse were tested and dose response
curves were compared to Cmax for each drug.

For most compounds tested, inhibition of MPNST viability occurred at drug
concentrations higher than Cmax. Doxorubicin was one of the best
compounds tested. Several compounds with less specific molecular targets
appear promising, however, currently available inhibitors of receptor
tyrosine kinase signaling pathways required concentrations above Cmax to
inhibit MPNST viability. These data suggest that difficulty in developing
therapy for MPNST may be due to the requirement for high concentrations
of drugs to inhibit MPNST cells.
