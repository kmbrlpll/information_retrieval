Title: An Antibody Drug Conjugate targeting HER-3 demonstrates promising
antitumor efficacy in a wide range of human cancer.


The HER-3 receptor is emerging as an attractive molecule in therapeutics
because of its overexpression across many human cancers and because of
its role in in several compensatory processes that underlay emergence of
resistance to certain cancer drugs. In this study, we present evidence of
the preclinical efficacy of a novel Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC)
targeting HER-3. It consists of a humanized HER-3 monoclonal antibody
(mAb EV20), which recognizes the HER-3 extracellular domain, conjugated
to different payloads (HER-3-ADC)s. In HER-3 expressing cancer cell
lines, these HER-3-ADCs demonstrated a powerful, specific and
target-dependent killing activity. High expression levels of HER-3 in
tumor cells correlated with efficient internalization, efficacy, and
cytotoxic effects in vitro. Efficacy studies demonstrated that HER-3-ADCs
treatment leads to a long lasting tumor growth inhibition of cell
line-based models of human head and neck, breast, pancreatic, prostatic,
lung, stomach cancers and melanoma. Overall, these findings validate
HER-3 as an attractive therapeutic target in multiple solid tumors and
support further clinical development and application of HER-3 targeting
ADCs.
