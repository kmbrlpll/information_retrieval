Title: Insights from engraftable immunodeficient mouse models of
hyperinsulinaemia.


Hyperinsulinemia, obesity and dyslipidemia are independent and collective
risk factors for many cancers, however, there is a lack of suitable mouse
models available to study this association.

We examined the long-term effects of a “Western style” 23% high fat
diet (HFD, 46% of total calculated energy from lipids) in two
immunodeficient mouse strains (NOD/SCID and Rag1 -/-) suitable for
engraftment with human-derived cell lines and tissue xenografts. HFD-fed
mice of both strains exhibited diet-induced impairments in glucose
tolerance at 16 and 23 weeks post initiation of HFD feeding. Only Rag1
-/- mice developed higher fasting insulin levels (2.16 ± 1.01ng/ml
versus 0.71 ± 0.12ng/ml, P = 0.01) and increased insulin resistance
(6.70 ± 1.68 HOMA-IR, versus 2.91 ± 0.42, P = 0.01) when fed a HFD.
Similarly, hepatic steatosis was more extensive, and intramyocellular
lipid storage was increased in HFD-fed Rag1 -/- mice. Conversely,
NOD/SCID mice exhibited relatively low levels of steatosis and no
intramyocellular lipid was observed. These data suggest that Rag1 -/-
mice are a more suitable pre-clinical model for examining the
interactions between hyperinsulinemia, obesity and hyperlipidemia and
cancer than the more commonly used NOD/SCID mouse model.

We next investigated the growth of human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3
and LNCaP) subcutaneously injected into hyperinsulinemic Rag1 -/- mice.
Compared to normal chow-fed mice, tumor growth velocity was greater in
HFD-fed mice with PC3 and LNCaP xenografts, and mice reached humane
endpoints (cancer-associated cachexia and tumor burden) significantly
earlier (P = 0.0078 and P = 0.031). Strikingly, HFD-fed mice bearing PC3
xenografts presented with significantly greater normalized wet tumor
weight (485.16 ± 143.80% vs. 1562.69 ± 338.20%, P = 0.032), tumor
volume (485.16 ± 143.80% vs.1562.69 ± 338.20%, P = 0.032) and number of
Ki67 positive (proliferating) tumor cells (36.08 ± 2.53% vs. 66.14 ±
8.514, P = 0.032), compared to mice fed a normal chow diet.

In summary, this is the first study of the metabolic effects of a
long-term “Western style” HFD in two immunodeficient mouse strains
suitable for xenograft studies. We demonstrate that the Rag1 -/- mouse is
an appropriate and novel model for studying the interactions between
hyperinsulinaemia and cancer.
