Title: Fc effector bioassays enable faster and quantitative measurement
of ADCC and ADCP mechanisms of action.


Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and
antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) are recognized as
important mechanisms of action (MOA) of therapeutic antibodies. Primary
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are routinely used in
traditional bioassays to measure potency, stability of antibody drugs in
ADCC and ADCP. However these methods are labor intensive and highly
variable. Here we report the development of a luciferase-based reporter
assay that measures activation of effector cells via cross-linking of Fc
receptors with target cell-bound antibodies. We will discuss functional
cell-based Fc effector reporter bioassays developed to measure Human
FcgRIIIa (V158 and F158 variants), Human FcgRIIa (H131 and R131
variants), Human FcgRI as well as Mouse FcgRIV and FcgRIII. Compared to
primary cell-based assays these reporter bioassays are less variable,
easier to use and provide more consistent analysis of the important MOAs
that are critical to for drug development programs. In qualification
studies, performed in accordance with ICH guidelines for antibody
screening and characterization, we tested the bioassays for specificity,
accuracy, precision and linearity.
