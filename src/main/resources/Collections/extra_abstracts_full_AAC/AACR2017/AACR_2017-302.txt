Title: A novel epigenetic pathway in medulloblastoma.


Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor with
variable prognosis due to its clinical and genomic heterogeneity. Despite
recent treatment advances, approximately 40% of children experience
tumour recurrence, and 30% will die from this disease. Therefore there is
a need to develop novel therapies for patients. We recently reported that
Casein kinase 1δ (CK1δ) may be an attractive therapeutic target for
medulloblastoma. CK1δ is a serine/threonine kinase that controls cell
cycle progression, signal transduction and neurogenesis. We found high
levels of CK1δ protein in mouse models of medulloblastoma and human
medulloblastoma samples. Furthermore, CK1δ inhibition dramatically
reduced medulloblastoma tumor progression. We demonstrate here that CK1δ
phosphorylates the epigenetic reader bromodomain-containing protein 4
(BRD4). BRD4 has been identified as a therapeutic target in several
cancers, including medulloblastoma. We demonstrate that CK1δ
phosphorylates BRD4 and that CK1δ is required for BRD4 binding to the
Gli1 promoter in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, combined CK1δ/BRD4
inhibition is a novel means of reducing medulloblastoma growth downstream
of SUFU and SMO. These studies define a novel therapeutic means of
inhibiting SMO inhibitor resistant medulloblastoma.
