Title: Dual carfilzomib and doxorubicin carrying nanoparticles for
synergistic efficacy in multiple myeloma.


We describe the synthesis and analysis of dual carfilzomib and
doxorubicin loaded nanoparticles in their ability to deliver both drugs
to multiple myeloma tumor cells at their optimal synergistic ratio.
First, to identify the optimal synergistic ratio, various molar ratios of
carfilzomib to doxorubicin were screened against multiple myeloma cell
lines using the Chou-Talalay method. Both therapeutic agents were then
incorporated into liposomes at the identified optimal synergistic ratio
of 1:1 to achieve dual drug loaded nanoparticles with a narrow size
distribution of ~100 nm and with high reproducibility. Our results
established that the dual drug loaded nanoparticles exhibited synergy in
vitro and were more efficacious in inhibiting tumor growth in vivo than a
combination of free drugs, while at the same time reducing systemic
toxicity. In conclusion, this study achieved the preclinical evaluation
of dual drug loaded liposomes containing carfilzomib and doxorubicin for
enhanced therapeutic efficacy to improve patient outcome in multiple
myeloma.
