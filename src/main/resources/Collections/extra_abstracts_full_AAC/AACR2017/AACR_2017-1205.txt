Title: Rubrofusarin and toralactone sensitize resistant MCF-7adr cell
line to paclitaxel via inhibiting P-glycoprotein efflux activity.


The use of anti-cancer adjuvant therapy is rationalized by potentiating
the efficacy and/or protecting from major side effects of
chemotherapeutics. Paclitaxel is an effective spindle toxin anticancer
agent used for the treatment of breast cancer. Rubrofusarin and
toralactone are naturally occurring structurally related naphthopyrones
with potent antioxidant and hence chemoprotective activity. The purpose
of this study is to investigate the influence of rubrofusarin and
toralactone on the cytotoxic profile of paclitaxel (PTX) against
chemo-resistant breast cancer cell line (MCF-7adr) compared to parent
MCF-7 cells. MCF-7adr was prepared by continuous culturing of MCF-7 cells
in media containing subcytotoxic concentration of doxorubicin (IC10%) for
two months duration. Toralactone and rubrofusarin showed moderate
cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 cells with IC50’s of 32.4±4.2 µM and
13.9±6.1 µM, respectively. Interestingly, toralactone and rubrofusarin
showed stronger cytotoxicity against MCF-7adr cells with IC50’s of
7.3±0.7 µM and 7.8±0.6 µM, respectively. PTX treatment was opposed by
significant resistance from MCF-7adr cells compared to parent MCF-7 cells
having IC50’s of 4.9±0.9 µM and 57.7±4.5 nM, respectively.
Combination of torolactone or rubrofusarin with PTX did not significantly
improve its cytotoxicity against MCF-7; IC50’s were 24.2±2.2 nM and
69.7±6.6 nM, respectively compared to 57.7±4.5 nM for PTX alone.
Surprisingly, combination with either torolactone or rubrofusarin
abolished the resistance of MCF-7adr to PTX resulting in IC50’s of
3.4±0.2 nM and 4.9±0.5 6 nM, respectively compared to 4.9±0.9 µM for
PTX alone. Using flowcytometric analysis, rubrofusarin and toralactone
increased median intracellular fluorescence signal count of rhodamine dye
(non-cytotoxic P-gp substrate) within MCF-7adr from 1794.7±21.5 to
2003.3±12.5 and 2113±10.5 cellular events, respectively. Using purified
membrane bound humanized recombinant P-gp molecules; it was found that
both rubrofusarin and toralactone might be inhibiting P-gp efflux
activity via dual interaction with both P-gp ATPase enzyme subunit and
P-gp active binding site. In both MCF-7 and MCF-7adr cells, PTX exerted
significant cell cycle block at G2/M-phase with significant increase in
the pre-G dead cell fraction from 3.4±0.9% to 23.6±2.1% and from
1.4±0.6% to 17.2±3.2%, respectively. Neither rubrofusarin nor
toralactone exerted any significant influence for PTX induced cell cycle
interruption in both normal (MCF-7) and resistant (MCF-7adr) cell lines.
In conclusion, rubrofusarin and toralactone can enhance the cytotoxic
profile of P-gp substrates, such as PTX, via inhibiting P-gp efflux
activity and enhancing the intracellular entrapment of P-gp substrates.
