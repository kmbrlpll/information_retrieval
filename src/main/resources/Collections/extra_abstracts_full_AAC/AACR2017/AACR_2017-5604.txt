Title: Novel biomarkers Ly6E/K play important role in drug resistance and
tumor immune escape.


Stem cell antigen Sca-1 is implicated in murine cancer stem cell biology
and breast cancer models, but the role of its human homologs Ly6K and
Ly6E in breast cancer are not established. Here we report increased
expression of Ly6K/E in human breast cancer specimens correlates with
poor overall survival, with an additional specific role for Ly6E in poor
therapeutic outcomes. Increased expression of Ly6K/E also correlated with
increased expression of the immune checkpoint molecules PDL1 and CTLA4,
increased tumor-infiltrating T regulatory cells, and decreased natural
killer (NK) cell activation. Mechanistically, Ly6K/E was required for
TGFβ signaling and proliferation in breast cancer cells, where they
contributed to phosphorylation of Smad1/5 and Smad2/3. Furthermore,
Ly6K/E promoted cytokine-induced PDL1 expression and activation and
binding of NK cells to cancer cells. Finally, we found that Ly6K/E
promoted drug resistance and facilitated immune escape in this setting.
Overall, our results establish a pivotal role for a Ly6K/E signaling axis
involving TGFβ in breast cancer pathophysiology and drug response, and
highlight this signaling axis as a compelling realm for therapeutic
invention.
