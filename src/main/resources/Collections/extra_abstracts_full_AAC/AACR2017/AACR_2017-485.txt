Title: Epigentic silencing of miR-142-3p promotes metastasis by targeting
ZEB2 in NPC.


Metastasis is the major cause of cancer-related death in nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC). However, the molecular mechanisms governing metastasis
remain poorly understood in NPC. Here, we demonstrated that miR-142-3p
was downregulated and significantly suppressed NPC cell migration,
invasion in vitro and in vivo. We identified zinc finger E-box binding
homeobox 2 (ZEB2) as a direct target of miR-142-3p, and its
overexpression rescued the inhibitory effects of miR-142-3p in NPC.
Importantly, miR-142-3p downregulation was associated with DNA
methylation within the miR-142 locus. Enhancer of zeste homologue 2
(EZH2) suppressed miR-142 methylation and miR-142-3p expression. Systemic
reversal of miR-142 silencing suppressed lung metastasis of NPC cells.
Furthermore, miR-142 hypermethylation was associated with poor
metastasis-free survival. This study demonstrates a suppressive role of
miR-142-3p in metastasis and uncovers an epigenetic mechanism for
miR-142-3p silencing in NPC, suggesting a potential prognostic factor and
therapeutic target to combat metastasis in NPC.
