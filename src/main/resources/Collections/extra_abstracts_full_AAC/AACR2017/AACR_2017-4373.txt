Title: SOX2-related gene signature predicting the prognosis in head and
neck squamous cell cancer.


Purpose: Numerous studies have indicated that Sex-determining region
Y-box 2 (SOX2) is involved in many squamous cell carcinomas. However, the
role of SOX2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains
unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether activation of SOX2 is
significantly associated with prognosis in HNSCC.

Methods: Gene expression signature reflecting SOX2 activation was
identified in HNSCC cohort, and patients were stratified into two groups
according to this signature: SOX2-high group or SOX2-low group.
Validation of the signature was sought in two independent patient groups.
The association between the signature and prognosis of patients was
assessed.

Results: The SOX2-low group was associated with poor prognosis for HNSCC
in three independent patient cohorts. In a multivariate analysis, the
impact of the SOX2 signature on overall survival (OS) was independent of
other clinical variables [hazard ratio (HR), 1.45; 95% confidence
interval (CI), 1.09 - 1.92; P=0.01]. In patients who received
radiotherapy (RT), SOX2-low group had significantly poor OS than those in
SOX2-high group.

Conclusions: SOX2-low signature is associated with poor prognosis in
patients with HNSCC and could be used to predict patients who would
benefit from RT.
