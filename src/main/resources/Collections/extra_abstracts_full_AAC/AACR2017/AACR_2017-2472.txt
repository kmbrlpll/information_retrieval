Title: Defining the role of the XAB2 complex during homologous
recombination.


Several factors associated with RNA processing are important for
homologous recombination (HR), but the mechanistic links between these
processes remain poorly understood. To this end, we have examined the
function of the tetratricopeptide repeat factor XAB2 in HR, since this
factor has a conserved function in RNA processing. We have found that
XAB2 is important for chromosomal double strand break (DSB) repair via
two pathways of HR that require end resection as an intermediate step,
end resection of camptothecin (Cpt) induced DNA damage, and RAD51
recruitment to ionizing radiation induced foci (IRIF). Furthermore, XAB2
mediates CtIP hyperphosphorylation induced by Cpt and BRCA1 IRIF, as well
as histone acetylation events linked to HR proficiency. The capacity for
XAB2 to promote HR correlates with its ability to form a complex with
ISY1 and PRP19, which show a similar influence as XAB2 on HR. Our recent
efforts include examining other members of the XAB2 complex, as well as
the transcription unit aberrations caused by loss of this complex, which
may contribute to the defects in HR.
