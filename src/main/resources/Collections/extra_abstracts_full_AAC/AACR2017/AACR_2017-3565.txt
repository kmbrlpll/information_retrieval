Title: Recurrently detected germline mutation of FLT3 (D358V) associated
with prevalence of hematopoietic malignancy and prognosis of AML patients.


FLT3 is most frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia patients.
While somatic mutation of FLT3 is well known, germline mutation of FLT3
and predispose to AML remain poorly understood. Here we identify a
germline FLT3 p.D358V affected prognosis of AML patients. We performed
whole exome sequencing (WES) using 76 patientsâ€™ saliva sample to detect
FLT3 germline mutation in buccal epithelial cell and demonstrate FLT3
p.D358V mutation for 6 patients among 76 patients. The frequency of FLT3
p.D358V mutation in AML patients is significantly higher in general
population (p=9.50E-07), suggesting association of FLT3 mutation with AML
predisposition. Asian population especially carried this locus more than
other ethic population. When we compared between AML patients and general
population of Asian, the chi-square p-value was 0.07 and odd ratio was
2.26. Overall survival was significantly reduced in patients who had FLT3
p.D358V mutation (p=0.03) and disease free survival was show a tendency
of reducing in the patients with FLT3 p.D358V mutation.
