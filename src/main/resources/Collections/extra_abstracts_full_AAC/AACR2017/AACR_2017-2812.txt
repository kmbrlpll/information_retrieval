Title: Development and characterization of the ultra immunodeficient
B6;129-Rag2tm1FwaIL2rgtm1Rsky/DwlHsd (R2G2) mouse model.


The “R2G2” (B6;129-Rag2tm1FwaIL2rgtm1Rsky/DwlHsd) knockout mouse is
the latest advancement to provide an alternative option in the highly
immunodeficient mouse model category for the oncology, immunology and
other biomedical research communities. This model was generated by
backcrossing an IL2rg (common gamma) knockout model to a RAG2
(recombinase activating gene) knockout model. The resulting mouse lacks
various cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15. In
addition, this model lacks B cells, T cells, NK cells and has a deficit
in lymphocyte development. The R2G2 model is not only ultra
immunodeficient, but provides a model that is less leaky and more
tolerant to gamma radiation than traditional SCID models. This model is
particularly useful for both tumor transplantation and humanization
studies. Herein we describe the development and characterization of the
R2G2 model, which includes breeding history, growth curve, CBC/Chemistry,
flow cytometry and both huHSC and huPMBC humanization studies.
