Title: Osimertinib (AZD9291) is effective against NSCLC cells harboring
EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.


Background: Although EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation is the third most
common among EGFR-mutant NSCLC, this mutant clones are resistant to the
first-generation EGFR TKIs. In addition, the efficacy of the second or
third-generation EGFR TKIs is unknown in NSCLC with EGFR exon 20
insertion mutation.

Methods: Various EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations were introduced into
Ba/F3 cells as follows: A763_Y764insFQEA in C-helix; and V769_D770insASV,
D770_N771insNPG, D770_N771insSVD, P772_H773insPR, H773_V774insNPH,
H773_V774insH, and H773_V774insAH in loop following C-helix. The
patient-derived SNU-3173 cell line was developed in a patient with
EGFRH773_V774insAH mutation. Ba/F3 cells transfected with EGFR exon 20
insertion mutations and SNU-3173 were exposed to the EGFR TKIs (the
1st-generation gefitinib and erlotinib; the 2nd-generation dacomitinib
and afatinib; and the 3rd-generation rociletinib, olmutinib, nazartinib,
and osimertinib) and cell viability assays were performed. In addition,
immunoblotting was performed to evaluate the downstream signals of EGFR
pathway.

Results: Cell viability assay showed that EGFR exon 20 insertion mutants
are resistant to the 1st-generation EGFR TKIs, except for
EGFRA763_Y764insFQEA-mutant Ba/F3 cells. IC50 values of the
2nd-generation EGFR TKIs are five to hundred-folds lower than the
1st-generation EGFR TKIs. The 2nd-generation EGFR TKIs were effective
against EGFR exon 20 inserted Ba/F3 cells and down-regulated EGFR
downstream signals. The 3rd-generation EGFR mutation-selective inhibitors
showed a moderate efficacy except osimertinib that was effective and
down-regulated EGFR downstream signals. In addition, SNU-3173 cells were
moderately toxic to afatinib (IC50 46.2±5.2nM) as well as osimertinib
(IC50 403.2±3.0nM).

Conclusions: Overall, osimertinib showed effectiveness against NSCLC
cells with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Our results warrant a
clinical trial of osimertinib in NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20
insertion mutations.
