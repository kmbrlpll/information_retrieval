Title: Oral IL-10 suppresses colon carcinogenesis via elimination of
pathogenic CD4+ T-cells and induction of antitumor CD8+ T-cell activity.


An oral sustained-release formulation of Interleukin-10 suppressed tumor
growth and enhanced survival in the APCmin/+ / Bacteroides fragilis
spontaneous colon cancer model. Therapeutic benefit was associated with a
5-fold reduction in CD4+RORɣt+Foxp3-IL-17+ T-helper cell,
CD4+RORɣt+Foxp3+IL-17+ pathogenic T-regulatory cell (pgTreg) and
CD4+RORɣt-Foxp3+IL-17- conventional T-regulatory cell (cTreg) numbers;
and a concurrent enhancement of CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity in the colonic
lamina propria. Selective subset depletion and functional blockade
studies demonstrated that CD4+RORɣt+IL-17+ T-cell subsets and CD4+Foxp3+
cTreg supported tumorigenesis/tumor progression whereas CD8+ cytotoxic
T-lymphocytes suppressed tumor growth. These findings establish the
utility of oral particulate IL-10 as a potential new therapeutic in the
management of colon cancer and shed light on the cellular mechanisms that
underlie its antitumor activity.
