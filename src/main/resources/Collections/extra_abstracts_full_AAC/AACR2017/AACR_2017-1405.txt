Title: A novel chemotherapeutic agent to treat tumors with DNA mismatch
repair deficiencies.


Impairing the division of cancer cells with genotoxic small molecules has
been a primary goal to develop chemotherapeutic agents. However, DNA
mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient cancer cells, are resistant to most
conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Here we have identified baicalein
as a small molecule that selectively kills MutSα-deficient cancer cells.
Baicalein binds preferentially to mismatched DNA and induces a DNA damage
response in a mismatch repair-dependent manner. In MutSα-proficient
cells, baicalein binds to MutSα to dissociate CHK2 from MutSα leading
to S phase arrest and cell survival. In contrast, continued replication
in the presence of baicalein in MutSα-deficient cells results in a high
number of DNA double-strand breaks and ultimately leads to apoptosis.
Consistently, baicalein specifically shrinks MutSα-deficient xenograft
tumors and inhibits the growth of AOM-DSS-induced colon tumors in
colon-specific MSH2 knockout mice. Collectively, baicalein offers the
potential of an improved treatment option for patients with tumors with a
DNA MMR deficiency.
