Title: Development of orthotopically grafted organoid models to study
pancreatic cancer progression.


Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most difficult human
malignancies to treat. The 5-year survival rate of PDA patients is 7% and
PDA is predicted to become the second leading cancer-related cause of
death in the USA. A subset of potential tumor suppressor genes was
identified by genome-wide analysis of human PDA and insertional
mutagenesis in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Since the
functional validation of these genes in GEMMs is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, we have developed a rapid and efficient
‘orthotopically grafted organoid’ (OGO) models in conjunction with
RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technology to study PDA progression. Previously, we
showed that OGO model represents the full spectrum of PDA progression in
vivo upon orthotopic engraftment. Here, as a proof-of-concept experiment,
we demonstrate that ablation of Trp53 by viral introduction of shRNA or
gRNA in PanIN-derived organoids accelerates PDA progression upon
transplantation. In addition, we engineered tetracyclin-inducible shRNA
against Trp53 in ColA1 locus by Flpe recombinase-mediated cassette
exchange in organoids derived from Kras +/G12D ; Rosa26-rtTA ;
ColA1-homing cassette mouse. Orthotopic transplantation followed by
doxycycline administration resulted in rapid PDA progression with
metastases. Isolated tumor organoids were re-transplanted to evaluate the
effect of p53 restoration in PDA progression. Restoration of p53 by
doxycycline withdrawal led to reduced liver metastases, although there
was no difference in survival and primary tumor growth. This will provide
a new insight how p53 regulates PDA metastasis. Therefore, OGO models
should provide an excellent platform to study the functional role of
genes in PDA progression in vivo.
