Title: ALK rearrangement analysis in circulating tumor cells of lung
cancer patients.


The evaluation of ALK rearrangement in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
is a significant tool when considering chemotherapy. It is not always
possible to perform a tumor biopsy in patients. We suggest isolation and
culturing of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as an alternative tool to a
tumor biopsy for the diagnosis of ALK rearrangement. From 22 patients
with NSCLC harboring ALK rearrangement, blood samples were collected and
divided into two parts: one for immunofluorescence staining of CTC marker
and the other for culturing of CTCs. Both samples were processed by
size-based filtration, and Cultured CTCs were analyzed for EML4-ALK
translocation by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using Vysis
ALK break apart FISH probe kit. CTC culturing was successful in 18 of 22
cases (81.8%). Among 18 cases of successful CTC cultures, 13 cases showed
ALK rearrangement positivity (72.2%). Therefore, we suggest that the CTCs
can be used as an alternative method to tissue biopsy for diagnosing ALK
rearrangement. In addition, this method may have clinical applications
including serial blood sampling for the development of personalized
cancer therapy based on individual genomic information.
