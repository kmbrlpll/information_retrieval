Title: Microsatellite instability is a potential biomarker for immune
checkpoint inhibitor in endometrial cancer.


[Introduction] In recent years, tumor cells have immune escape mechanism
and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (anti PD-1/ PD-L1 antibody) has
shown benefit in various cancers. Somatic mutations have the potential to
encode ‘’non-self’’immunogenic antigens and lymphocytes
infiltrate tumor cells in Microsatellite-instable (MSI) endometrial
cancers. Therefore, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy might be
effective in MSI endometrial cancers.

[Method] Mismatch repair protein (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6),
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8), and PD-1/PD-L1 expression were
assessed by immunohistochemistry in 60 patients with endometrial cancer.
We examined whether MSI status have enhanced immune microenvironment and
become the therapeutic effect predictor of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in
endometrial cancer.

[Results] Loss of mismatch repair protein (MSI group) was identified in 8
(13.3 %) of 60 patients with endometrial cancer. Expression of
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8) and PD-L1/PD-1 were significantly
higher in MSI group compared to MSS group (p=0.001, p=0.044 and p=0.013).

[Conclusion]These results suggested that immune checkpoint inhibitor
(anti PD-1/PD-L1 antibody) is effective in endometrial cancers with MSI.
MSI testing is likely to be a biomarker for PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in
endometrial cancer.
