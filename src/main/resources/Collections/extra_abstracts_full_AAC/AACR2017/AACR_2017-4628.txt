Title: Selection of Smad2 for TGF-β to suppress dendritic cells by
STAT3/c-Ski-induced repression of Smad3.


The mechanisms how Smad-mediated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)
signalling regulates dendritic cells (DCs) remain largely unknown,
despite its crucial regulatory roles in the differentiation and
activation of DCs. Here, we show that STAT3/c-Ski-induced downregulation
of Smad3 during differentiation selects Smad2 as the specific TGF-β
receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) to suppress the immunogenicity of DCs.
Smad3 transcribed by unphosphorylated Smad2/3 prevented the progenitor
cells from DC differentiation with repression of Flt3, IRF4 and STAT3.
Repression of Smad3 by synergy of phosphorylated STAT3 and c-Ski was
essential for DC differentiation. TGF-β suppressed DC activation via
Smad2, hence DC-specific Smad2 deletion enhanced anti-lymphoma effector
functions of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and type 1 helper T (Th1)
cells in a mouse EL4 lymphoma model. Our findings reveal stepwise
regulatory roles of R-Smads in DC regulation: Smad3 inhibits
differentiation and Smad2 suppresses immunogenicity.
