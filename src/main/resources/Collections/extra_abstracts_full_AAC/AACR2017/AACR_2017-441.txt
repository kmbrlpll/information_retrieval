Title: GOT1 regulates anaplerotic glutamine metabolism under chronic
acidosis stress in pancreatic cancer.


Epithelial-cell derived tumors exhibit the Warburg effect that is
characterized by an increased rate of glycolysis and lactate release, as
well as, reduced oxidative metabolism. It is known that these metabolic
alterations of cancer cells result in a tumor microenvironment with a
lower pH than that of the plasma. However, little is known regarding the
physiology and metabolism of cancer cells enduring chronic acidosis.
Here, we cultured pancreatic cancer cells in chronic acidosis, i.e. pH
6.9 to 7.0, and observed a shift from glycolytic metabolism to oxidative
metabolism that also results in reduced cell growth and increased
intracellular ROS levels. We identified that this is due to an increase
in glutamine uptake and increased expression of the transaminase enzyme
GOT1 that enhances glutamine metabolism. Survival in low pH is reduced
upon depletion of GOT1 due to further increased intracellular ROS levels.
Thus, GOT1 plays an important role in energy metabolism and ROS balance
in chronic acidosis stress. Our studies suggest the therapeutic potential
of targeting anaplerotic glutamine metabolism in pancreatic cancer.
