Title: Molecular mechanism underlying breast cancer cell radioresistance:
role of radiation-induced NF-ΚB self-sustenance.


Understanding the mechanism of breast cancer cell radioresistance and the
associated selection pressure, tumor recurrence, would help us to develop
molecular interventions and achieve disease/progression-free survival in
patients with cancer. In the present study, we investigated the molecular
mechanisms prompted in breast cancer cells in response to clinical
radiation and the associated coordination of intra- and inter-cellular
signaling that orchestrate radioresistance and tumor relapse/recurrence.
Our findings showed that clinical doses of radiation increase NF-κB
transcription and DNA-binding activity. Further, radiation exposure
resulted in de novo TNF-α synthesis and secretion. An NF-κB gene
manipulation approach revealed that NF-κB triggered NF-κB-mediated
TNF-α transcriptional activity. NF-κB DNA binding kinetic analysis
demonstrated both sustained and dual phase NF-κB activation with
radiation. Radiation prompted NF-κB-dependent synthesis/secretion of
TNF-α, a requisite for the second phase of NF-κB activation and
maintenance. Radiation-associated NF-κB-dependent secretion of TNF-α
from irradiated cells also activated NF-κB in the non-irradiated,
non-targeted bystander cells. Together, these findings demonstrated that
radiation-triggered NF-κB-dependent TNFα secretion is critical for
self-sustenance of NF-κB (through autocrine positive feedback signaling)
and for coordinating bystander response (through intercellular signaling:
de novo activation of NF-κB in bystander cells) after radiation
exposure. Further, the data suggest that this NF-κB→TNF-α→NF-κB
feedback-dependent self-sustenance of NF-κB could drive the selection
pressure (proliferation, clonal expansion) of surviving breast cancer
cells and subsequent tumor relapse/recurrence.
