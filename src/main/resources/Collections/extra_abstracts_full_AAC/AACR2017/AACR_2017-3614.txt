Title: Antibody validation revises estrogen receptor beta research.


The discovery of estrogen receptor β (ERβ/ESR2) in 1996 was a landmark
discovery. Its homology with breast cancer pharmacological target and
predictive biomarker estrogen receptor α (ERα /ESR1) raised hopes for
improved endocrine therapies. However, after twenty years of intense
research the therapeutic promises have not materialized. We here perform
a rigorous validation of 13 anti-ERβ antibodies, and demonstrate that
the vast majority are unspecific. Using well-characterized controls and a
panel of validation methods, we conclude that only the rarely used
monoclonal antibody PPZ0506 targets ERβ in a specific manner in
immunohistochemistry. We applied this antibody for protein expression
profiling in 44 normal and 21 malignant human tissues, and found that
detection of ERβ protein is limited to testis, ovary, placenta, lymphoid
cells, granulosa cell tumors, and a subset of malignant melanoma and
thyroid cancers. This expression pattern aligns well with RNA-seq data,
but contradicts a multitude of studies. We did not find evidence that
normal or cancerous human breast express ERβ protein. Our study
highlights how inadequately validated antibodies can lead an exciting and
promising field astray.
