Title: Depletion of Mastl kinase inhibits cancer growth by induction of
mitotic catastrophe in breast cancer.


Targeting mitotic kinase is an emerging anticancer strategy with
promising pre-clinical results. Mastl is an essential mitotic kinase
regulating mitotic progression by inactivation of a tumor suppressor
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). However, it is unclear whether inhibition
of Mastl kinase can kills tumor cells. Here, we show that Mastl
inhibition selectively kills cancer cells by induction of mitotic
catastrophe in breast cancer cells. We found that Mastl overexpression
was tightly associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in
breast cancer. Mastl depletion with specific siRNAs induced cell death in
Mastl high breast cancer cells, but not in Mastl low breast cancer cells.
Interestingly, Mastl depletion did not affect the viability of normal
cells. In addition, Mastl depletion reduced the oncogenic properties of
breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that Mastl depletion caused
mitotic catastrophe. Therefore, our data indicate that inhibition of
Mastl can selectively kill breast cancer cells by induction of mitotic
catastrophe, providing that targeting Mastl kinase is a very useful
approach for breast cancer treatment.
