Title: Role of CLCA2 in proliferation of certain growth-factor receptor
dependent cancers.


The CLCA2 gene is downregulated in most adenocarcinomas, suggesting it is
a tumor suppressor gene. However, we have observed that CLCA2 is
upregulated in squamous carcinomas and Her2+ breast cancers. Such cancers
also upregulate the calcium-activated chloride channel Ano1 along with
EGFR or Her2. Others have reported that Ano1 enhances EGFR signaling and
that Ano1 knockdown confers sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. Both EGFR and
Her2 are known to transduce their mitogenic signal in part by causing
release of intracellular calcium. We have found that CLCA2 activates Ano1
by upregulating intracellular calcium. Moreover, knockdown of CLCA2
reduced EGFR activation and cell proliferation while it enhanced
sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib. These
observations suggest that EGFR/Her2, Ano1, and CLCA2 comprise a
feed-forward loop that amplifies growth factor signaling, so that certain
cancer cell types maintain expression of all three.
