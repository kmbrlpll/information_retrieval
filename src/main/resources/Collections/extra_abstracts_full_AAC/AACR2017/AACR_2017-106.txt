Title: Traditional medicinal plants effect on five cancer cell lines.


Cancer refers to as a group of numerous diseases that can originate in
various parts of the body. From the beginning of human history natural
compounds have been used for medical purposes. Many of the most
frequently used natural compounds have their origin from plants. Plants
are very diverse and responsible for the synthesis of a number different
secondary compounds. Scientist and non-scientist have taken advantage of
these secondary compounds treatment of a variety of diseases. In the
current study, we are investigating the viability of specific cancer cell
lines after exposure to methanolic extracts from each of the following
plants. The plants are Costus, Fenugreek, and Rhamnus. The cell lines
used in this investigation are lung cancer (A549), colon cancer, (SW620
and Colo320), breast cancer (BT549), and cervical cancer (HeLa). The
determination of cell viability found inhibition. The three test
compounds were methanolic extracts from the plants Costus, Fenugreek, and
Rhamnus. All showed different levels of viability and was dependent on
the specific cell line.
