Title: Germline structural variant detection with variation graphs.


Structural variants play a major role in many cancers. However, classical
methods of detection rely on searching for mapping signatures and a
perpetual “rediscovering” of variants relative to the reference. A
more efficient technique would be to map directly against known variants.
We present a novel method for detecting known structural variants in
next-generation sequencing data using variation graphs. Variation graphs
are reference-like structures that succinctly encode the variation
present within a population. Existing tools enable reads to be
efficiently mapped against this graph structure. We are able to speed up
queries for the presence or absence of variants by reducing the operation
to a simple lookup in an external index. The current implementation of
our variation graph approach is open source and publically available as
part of the variation graph toolkit (https://github.com/vgteam/vg). Our
method of variant typing on variation graphs has great potential to model
and assess the complexity of cancer genomes while remaining efficient
enough to make analysis tractable.
