Title: Characterization of M2 macrophage subtype content in cancer and
normal tissues.


Tumor-associated macrophages play an important role in presenting tumor
antigens to T cells and are being investigated for their role in
sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 inhibitors. The
M2 macrophage subtype, characterized by CD163 expression, is
immunosuppressive and associated with poor prognosis. A multiplex
CD68/CD163 immunohistochemical assay was developed to characterize the
density of cells expressing each marker and determine the percentage of
macrophages that are of the M2 subtype. The assay was used to analyze 22
normal tissue types and 50 tumor tissues within 5 different indications.
The results were analyzed by image analysis and results were analyzed as
percent positive and density per mm2. Cancer tissues expressed a greater
percentage of CD163+ macrophages than normal tissues.
