Title: Preclinical development of MVT-1075 as radioimmunotherapy for
pancreatic cancer and other CA19-9 positive malignancies.


Rationale: The CA19-9 antigen is frequently overexpressed in pancreatic
and other GI tumors. MVT-5873 (HuMab-5B1), a fully human monoclonal
antibody currently in phase I study, targets the sialyl Lewis A (sLea)
epitope on CA19-9, and is a promising platform for development of a
targeted radioimmunotherapy (RIT). MVT-5873 was conjugated with the
chelator CHX-A″-DTPA and radiolabeled with the beta-emitting isotopes
Lutetium -177 (177Lu) or Yttrium-90 (90Y) to form the RIT agents MVT-1075
(177Lu- CHX-A″-DTPA-HuMAb-5B1) and MVT-1916 (90Y-
CHX-A″-DTPA-HuMAb-5B1), respectively. The antitumor efficacy of each of
the constructs was studied in nude mice bearing BxPC3 human pancreatic
tumor xenografts, known to express CA19-9.

Methods: The initial dose-finding studies utilized doses of MVT-1075 of
75-450 μCi and MVT-1916 of 25-250 μCi, administered to groups of mice
(n = 8) bearing subcutaneous (subQ) BxPC3 tumors (~ 150 mm3). Further
studies focused on MVT-1075 and assessed antitumor effect in an
orthotopic xenograft model, the effect of dose fractionation, and
biodistribution in nontumor bearing (normal) and BxPC3 tumor-bearing mice.

Results: A single dose of MVT-1075 at 75, 150, 300, or 450 μCi
significantly inhibited subQ BxPC3 tumor growth at all dose levels, with
sustained suppression with higher doses. MVT-1916 produced similar
results. MVT-1075 was selected based on the favorable half-life of 177Lu
(6.7 d) and its utility for clinical biodistribution assessments. In an
orthotopic BxPC3 tumor model, treatment with a single dose of MVT-1075 at
300 μCi significantly inhibited tumor growth, with Day 20 tumor volume
approximately 50% that of the initial starting volume. A third BxPC3
xenograft study evaluated fractionated dosing schedules, (150 μCi x 1,
75 μCi x 2, 50 μCi x3), with both single-dose and fractionated
schedules effectively inhibiting subQ BxPC3 tumor growth. Biodistribution
studies in normal mice showed an expected gradually decreasing activity
in blood, heart, and lungs, with low uptake in normal pancreas. In subQ
BxPC3 tumor-bearing mice, tumor uptake was rapid, reaching 69% ID/g by 24
h and 86% ID/g by 120 h. Otherwise, the biodistribution pattern
paralleled that of normal mice, with relative %ID/g values within about
± 25% of normal mice across all time points comparing blood, heart,
lungs, kidneys, and pancreas, with slightly higher uptake in liver and
slightly lower uptake in spleen.

Conclusions: MVT-1075 demonstrates promising antitumor activity in a
human pancreatic cancer xenograft model, with efficacy shown in both
single dose and fractionated schedules. Biodistribution shows rapid and
substantial tumor uptake, with much lower uptake in normal organs. These
findings support the phase I clinical trial of MVT-1075 in patients with
CA19-9 positive pancreatic cancers planned to begin in early 2017.
