Title: A novel method for high-throughput discovery of neo-antigens and
corresponding T-cell receptors.


Immunotherapies that boost the ability of endogenous T cells to destroy
cancer cells have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in several human
malignancies. Cytotoxic T cells actively recognize peptide antigens,
which are displayed on major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on the
surface of the malignant cells, to play a central role in cancer
immunotherapy. However, efficient methods for identifying the tumor
antigens and the corresponding T cell receptors are still limited. We
report here a DNA-barcode nanoparticle and microfluidics-based method to
sort and enumerate neoantigen-specific T cells, at an unprecedented level
of sensitivity. The method also permits the matching of a single
neoantigen to a specific CD8+ T cell with the TCR a/b gene sequence. The
resultant information informs an immunotherapy regimen that is specific
for that patient, which can be used to custom-design effective ACT
therapies.
