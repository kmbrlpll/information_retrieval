Title: The protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit PR70 is a gonosomal
melanoma tumor suppressor gene.


Male gender is independently and significantly associated with poor
prognosis in melanoma of all clinical stages. The biological
underpinnings of this sex difference remain largely unknown, but we
hypothesize that gene expression from gonosomes may play an important
role. The current study demonstrates that loss of the inactivated X
chromosome in melanomas arising in females is strongly associated with
poor distant metastasis-free survival, suggesting a dosage benefit of two
X-chromosomes. The gonosomal PPP2R3B gene is located on the
pseudo-autosomal region (PAR) of the X-chromosome in females and on the
Y-chromosome in males. We observed that despite its location on the PAR
that predicts equal dosage across genders, PPP2R3B expression is lower in
males than in females, and is independently correlated with poor clinical
outcome. PPP2R3B codes for the PR70 protein, a regulatory substrate
recognizing subunit of PP2A, that decreases melanoma growth by negatively
interfering with DNA replication and cell cycle progression through its
role in stabilizing CDC6/CDT1 interaction that delays the firing of
origins of DNA replication. As such, PR70 behaves functionally as an
X-linked tumor suppressor gene.
