Title: Transcription activators that regulate PKC- ἱ expression and are
downstream targets of PKC- ἱ.


Protein Kinase C-iota (PKC-ἱ) is an anti-apoptotic oncogene
over-expressed in multiple cancers including prostate, ovarian, and
glioma. PKC-ἱ is part of a cycle that helps cancer cell avoid
senescence by releasing the transcription factor NFkB and promoting
apoptotic resistance. PKC-ἱ is activated externally by factors like
loss of PTEN (Paget 2012). However, while under the effect PKC-ἱ
specific inhibitors, expression levels decreased, suggesting PKC-ἱ
plays a role in regulating its own expression. A previous study showed
the ELK1 transcription factor to be a regulator of PKC-ἱ (Gustafson
2003). Other transcription factors including Jun, ISGF3, PAX3, EGR1, and
FOXO1 bind on or near the promoter sequence of the gene and their role in
PKC-ἱ regulation was analyzed. Each transcription factor was
systematically silenced with its own siRNA. Western Blotting revealed
expression of PKC-ἱ in the transcription factor silenced cells
determining which transcription factors are key players in regulation of
PKC-ἱ. qPCR and microarray were performed to analyze the transcriptome
of treated cells to match protein levels with mRNA levels. Targets both
up and downstream of PKC-ἱ were analyzed to find the pathway that
PKC-ἱ uses to help regulate itself.
