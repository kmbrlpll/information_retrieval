Title: HRAS G12V predicts for innate resistance to PI3Kα inhibition in
head and neck squamous cell cancer.


Introduction: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth
most common cancer worldwide, with an incidence of ~600 000 new cases per
year and a 50% mortality rate for advanced disease. The mutational
landscape of HNSCC has been recently elucidated, introducing the
possibility for targeted therapeutic approaches. PIK3CA—which encodes
the α-catalytic subunit of PI3K (PI3Kα)—is the most frequently
altered actionable target in HNSCC, however it is not presently clear
which patients benefit most from PI3Kα-inhibition. BYL719 is a leading
PI3Kα inhibitor in clinical development for HNSCC. We previously
examined the responses of a large panel of genetically-characterized
HNSCC cell lines to BYL719 and identified activating HRAS G12V mutations
as strong predictors for BYL719 resistance. Here we examine if this
mutation is able to individually modulate BYL719 response through
overexpression and knockdown studies.

Methods: To determine if HRAS G12V was able to modulate BYL719
sensitivity, we knocked down HRAS in HRAS G12V and HRAS wild-type (WT)
cell lines using RNA interference, and then treated cells over 10-point
dose ranges with BYL719. Sensitivity was determined by calculating IC50
(half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values at 72 hours using
PrestoBlue®. Constructs expressing wildtype (WT) HRAS or HRAS G12V were
transfected into BYL719-sensitive cells for overexpression studies and
cells were selected using G418 Sulfate for 1 month. Proliferation and
BYL719 sensitivity (IC50 values) were measured as described.
Immunoblotting was used to examine activity of the PI3K-AKT axis with and
without BYL719 (1μM) for 24 hours.

Results & Conclusions: HRAS knockdown sensitized HRAS G12V lines to
BYL719 (lower IC50), but did not affect the response of WT HRAS cells. WT
HRAS and HRAS G12V overexpression significantly increased cellular
proliferation and promoted BYL719 resistance. In HRAS G12V cell lines, we
observed high levels of active phosphorylated AKT (S473/T308), even in
the presence of BYL719. Collectively these findings highlight the
predictive role of HRAS G12V for innate BYL719 resistance and contribute
to our understanding of which patients may respond best on BYL719 therapy.
