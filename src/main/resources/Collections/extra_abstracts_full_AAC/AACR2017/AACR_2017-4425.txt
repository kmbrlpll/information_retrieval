Title: Analysis of host-Epstein-Barr virus microRNA expression in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma.


In the tumorigenesis process, miRNAs could act as oncogenes or tumor
suppressor genes in the cancer cells by regulating miRNA target genes.
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can
also influence the occurrence of NPC through its miRNAs. In this study,
we used the next generation sequencing technology to analysis host-viral
miRNA profiles in 24 NPC and 5 adjacent normal tissues. In average,
10.62% of mappable reads mapped to EBV genome in NPC tissue. Most of the
small RNAs in NPC tissues which mapped to EBV genome were miRNAs
(95.51%), rest of them were EBERs (1.80%) and v-snoRNA1 (2.68%). The
percentages of EBV miRNA in total human and EBV mature miRNA reads were
ranged from 4% to 51% (average 29.61%). For EBV miRNAs, the expression
level of BART10-3p and BART9-3p were the top two in NPC tumors.
BART20-5p, BART19-3p and BART21-5p were correlated to tumor stage. On the
other hand, there were 11 and 34 human miRNAs differentially up- and
down-regulated in NPC tissue, respectively. The present research provides
the first evidence obtained through direct sequencing to systematically
and comprehensively describe the expression of EBV and human miRNAs in
NPC tissue.
