Title: Lenalidomide and SMAC mimetic LCL161 show combination activity in
cells harboring loss of chromosome 5q.


LCL161 is a small molecule SMAC mimetic that binds to cIAP1, cIAP2, and
XIAP and sensitizes cancer cells to TNF-alpha as well as other inducers
of cell death. An siRNA screen was performed in the SK-OV-3 cancer cell
line to identify genes that when knocked down prevent LCL161-mediated
cell death. As expected, siRNAs targeting RIPK1 rescued cells from
LCL161-induced death. Unexpectedly, siRNAs targeting GPR68 also rescued
cells from LCL161-induced death. Since knockdown of GPR68 has been
reported to rescue myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-derived cells harboring
loss of chromosome 5q from lenalidomide treatment, we tested for
combination activity with lenalidomide plus LCL161 in 7-day in vitro
proliferation assays. Interestingly, combination activity was observed in
the SET-2 cell line harboring cytogenetic features of MDS including loss
of chromosome 5q. These data suggest that, in combination, LCL161 may
improve responses to lenalidomide in subsets of MPN and MDS patients and
potentially additional contexts where lenalidomide is active.
