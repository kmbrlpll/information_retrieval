Title: CCL18-recruited naïve CD4+ T cells are converted to
tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells in breast cancer and suppress
antitumor immunity.


Tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a central role in
tumor immunosuppression. However, it remains unclear whether they are
directly recruited from peripheral blood or converted from infiltrating
naïve T cells. Here, full-length TCR α/β repertoire analysis of
different T cell subsets from peripheral blood, primary tumors and
draining lymph nodes in patents suggests that Tregs in human breast
cancer are mainly converted from tumor-infiltrating naïve CD4+ T cells.
Infiltration of naïve CD4+ T cells and Tregs are closely correlated,
both indicating poor prognosis for breast cancer patients. Naïve CD4+ T
cells in the tumors are recruited by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
via CCL18. In addition, naïve T cells and memory T cells exhibit
distinctive chemotactic response due to different expression of regulator
of G-protein signaling 1(RGS1). Specific silencing CCL18 receptor-PITPNM3
in naïve CD4+ T cells using CD4 aptamer-siRNA blocks their chemotaxis,
and thus reduces infiltrating Tregs and inhibits tumor progression in
humanized mice. By comparison, silencing RGS1 in memory CD8+ T cells
using CD8 aptamer-siRNA enhance their recruitment to tumors and
anti-tumor immune response in vivo. These findings provide mechanistic
insights for Treg enrichment in breast cancer and suggest that
modification of the CCL18-PITPNM3-RGS1 signaling pathway may be an
attractive strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.
