Title: Designing for success: the right CRISPR design strategies for the
right experiment.


CRISPR design is a complex multivariate problem. The weight of each
variable differs depending on the experiment under consideration. Current
methods of designing CRISPR experiments are based on a single-variable,
resulting in poor experimental outcomes. From the numerous experiments
enabled by the DESKGEN platform, we can demonstrate key design
improvements to maximise experimental outcome.

Our current scoring methods were tested and validated using an sgRNA
library of over 3,500 sgRNAs in essential genes with a variety of
predicted sgRNA activities and specificities. The predicted 'good' sgRNAs
achieved significantly higher read depletion for essential genes, with
fewer failing sgRNAs, compared to sgRNAs that didn't meet the scoring
criteria. Our scoring algorithm incorporates multiple published
observations for choosing effective sgRNAs, which differs from other
CRISPR tools that tend to focus on one factor such as sgRNA sequence or
specificity. We were unable to find correlations for some currently
accepted sgRNA selection criteria, such as position within a gene, which
demonstrates the need to constantly challenge and improve sgRNA design
rules.
