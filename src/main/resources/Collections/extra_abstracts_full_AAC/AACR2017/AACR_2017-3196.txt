Title: Genetic and pharmacologic approaches to overcome epithelial to
mesenchymal mediated chemoresistance in breast cancer.


Development of resistance to conventional chemotherapy remains a major
barrier to effective treatment of breast cancer. We and others have
recently demonstrated in breast and pancreatic cancer models that
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may not be a critical mediator of
cancer metastasis, however, it contributes to cancer drug resistance
(Fischer et al. Nature 2015; Zeng et al Nature 2015). Importantly,
blocking EMT through miR-200 family abrogated chemoresistance, indicating
potentials for clinical translation. Using our novel EMT lineage tracing
system, we have performed both genetic (CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome-wide
targeted mutagenesis) and pharmacological (high-throughput small molecule
libraries) screens, to identify potential candidates to overcome
EMT-mediated chemoresistance in breast cancer metastasis. The identified
molecules provide not only novel mechanistic insights but also attractive
anti-metastatic strategies for breast cancer treatment and the design of
future clinical trials.
