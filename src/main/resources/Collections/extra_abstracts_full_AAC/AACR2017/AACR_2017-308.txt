Title: The PP2A-B56 phosphatase opposes cyclin E autocatalytic
degradation via site-specific dephosphorylation.


Cyclin E, in conjunction with its catalytic partner cyclin-dependent
kinase 2 (CDK2), regulates cell cycle progression as cells exit
quiescence and enter S-phase. Multiple mechanisms control cyclin E-CDK2
activity during the cell cycle, including phosphorylation-dependent
cyclin E ubiquitylation by the SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase. Serine 384
(S384) is the critical cyclin E phosphorylation site that stimulates Fbw7
binding and subsequent cyclin E degradation. Because S384 is
autophosphorylated by CDK2, cyclin E therefore instigates its own
degradation in an autocatalytic manner. This presents a paradox as to how
cyclin E-CDK2 is able to phosphorylate its numerous substrates prior to
cyclin E autophosphorylation-catalyzed degradation. Here we find that the
PP2A-B56 phosphatase specifically dephosphorylates cyclin E at S384,
thereby uncoupling cyclin E degradation from cyclin E-CDK2 activity.
Furthermore, the rate of S384 dephosphorylation is high in interphase and
low in mitosis, allowing PP2A-B56 to oppose autocatalytic cyclin E
degradation and maintain cyclin E-CDK2 activity at the G1/S transition.
