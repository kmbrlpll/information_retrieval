Title: Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 splice
variants have opposing functions in the epithelial to mesenchymal
transition pathway.


Alternative splicing of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding
protein 2 (CPEB2) generates two isoforms, CPEB2B and CPEB2A, through
inclusion/exclusion of exon 4, respectively, in mature mRNA. We
previously reported that CPEB2B is essential to establish anoikis
resistance (AnR), and promotes metastasis using in vivo orthotopic
models. In contrast, CPEB2A decreases AnR and metastatic transformation.
In the current studies, we examined the function of CPEB2 isoforms using
next generation sequencing analysis of downstream signaling pathways. We
found that CPEB2B expression upregulated AnR in breast cancer cells and
induced key genes/proteins in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and hypoxic response (hypoxia inducible factor 1α
(HIF1α)-dependent) pathways. Inhibition of either TWIST1 or HIF1α
reduced the CPEB2B-mediated AnR in cells ectopically expressing CPEB2B,
confirming a link between CPEB2 alternative splicing and the induction of
the EMT/hypoxia pathways. We then extended our findings, and demonstrated
that CPEB2 alternative splicing induced de novo translation of both
HIF1α and TWIST1, whereas CPEB2A decreased translation of these factors.
Furthermore, CPEB2 isoforms were found to modulate differential
polyadenylation site selection of the TWIST1 3’UTR and competed for
binding to HIF1α and TWIST1 3’UTR cytoplasmic polyadenylation element
(CPE) site sequences. These results demonstrate that CPEB2A and CPEB2B
modulate the translation of factors in the EMT/hypoxia pathways in an
opposing fashion via differential polyadenylation site selection and
subsequent translation.
