Title: Evaluation of FF-10502-01, a new pyrimidine nucleoside analogue,
in pancreatic (PANC) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models compared to
gemcitabine and in combination with nab-paclitaxel.


Introduction

FF-10502-01 is a synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue structurally
similar to gem with a substitution of sulfur for oxygen in the pentose
sugar. In previous studies, FF-10502-01 demonstrated preclinical efficacy
across multiple solid tumors, including PANC cancer. In this study, we
investigated the anti-tumor effect of FF-10502-01 in PANC PDX models.

Methods

10 PANC PDX tumors were sourced from primary (2) or metastatic sites (8).
7 demonstrated high resistance (HR) to gem, 1 intermediate, and 2 low. In
the dose-finding study, 3 PDX models were studied in 9 grps of NOD-SCID
mice (n=10/grp), treated with 240 or 480 mg/kg FF-10502-01, 3 or 6 mg/kg
nab-pac or 240 mg/kg gem, alone and in combination for 28d, followed by
28d observation. The definitive study consisted of 7 PDX models. 6 grps
(n=10/grp) were treated with 240 or 480 mg/kg FF-10502-01, 6 mg/kg
nab-pac or 240 mg/kg gem, alone and/or in combination for 28d, followed
by 28d observation. After subcutaneous transplantation, animals were left
undisturbed for 7d. Animals were monitored weekly and tumor volume
measured with calipers. Average tumor volume (mm3) for each group at
randomization into treatment grps ranged from 184.34 – 199.51 (SD ±
20.94 – 30.40). Statistical significance was determined using one-way
ANOVA and Tukey’s test.

Results

At clinically relevant doses, FF-10502-01, alone and in combination with
nab-pac demonstrated greater tumor growth suppression than
vehicle-treated animals (p≤0.0001). In 7 models, FF-10502-01/nab-pac
demonstrated higher tumor growth suppression than gem/nab-pac (p≤0.5,
p≤0.01 or p≤0.001), irrespective of resistance to gem. In 3 models,
there was no difference, but these models were highly responsive to
gem/nab-pac, thus minimizing the effects of FF-10502-01/nab-pac. Despite
statistical insignificance, FF-10502-01/nab-pac still demonstrated
greater tumor growth inhibitory activity to gem/nab-pac. In HR gem
models, FF-10502-01 was superior to gem (p≤0.0001, p≤0.001, p≤0.05)
in 3 of 7, and FF-10502-01/nab-pac was superior to gem/nab-pac in 6 of 7
(p nab-pac (p≤0.0001, p≤0.0001, p≤0.01, p≤0.05).
FF-10502-01/nab-pac also was more tolerable than gemcitabine/nab-pac, as
demonstrated by less weight loss.

Conclusions

FF-10502-01 is a new pyrimidine nucleoside analogue with demonstrated
preclinical efficacy in solid tumors, including PANC cancer. In PANC PDX
models, FF-10502-01 alone and in combination with nab-pac demonstrated
higher efficacy and better tolerability than gem alone or gem/nab-pac.
FF-10502-01 is in Phase 1 clinical development.
