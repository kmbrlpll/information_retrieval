Title: Benzaldehyde suppresses the binding activity of overexpressed
14-3-3ζ to multiple signaling proteins in cancer cells.


Benzaldehyde is the simplest aromatic aldehyde constituent of almonds and
many fruits. Anticancer effect of Benzaldehyde was first reported in
1980, and multi-institutional clinical trials were performed in those
days in Japan. However, trial was over without determination of
effectiveness, only its’ safety was confirmed. The underlying mechanism
why Benzaldehyde specifically suppresses growth of some particular cancer
cells but not that of normal cells has not been elucidated. Therefore, we
attempted to clarify the mechanism of anticancer effect of Benzaldehyde.
We have previously reported that, in pancreatic cancer cell BxPC3 and in
non-small cell lung cancer cell A549, Benzaldehyde inhibits
PI3K/AKT/mTOR, STAT3, NFκB and ERK pathways, those are major signaling
pathways activated in cancer cells. Effects of Benzaldehyde on multiple
signaling pathways are found to be derived from regulation of 14-3-3
family proteins which interact with phosphorylation sites of various
proteins of multiple signals. In BxPC3 cells, Benzaldehyde treatment
reduced the phosphorylation levels of 14-3-3-binding sites. Moreover, we
ectopically expressed seven isoforms of 14-3-3 in HEK293T cells and found
that Benzaldehyde treatment significantly suppressed association of
14-3-3ζ with client proteins such as mTOR, Rictor, cRaf, STAT3 and
FOXOs. The interaction of other isoforms of 14-3-3 with their client
proteins was also partially reduced. But, the expression levels of those
seven 14-3-3 isoforms were not significantly changed. Here we further
analysis the Benzaldehyde-mediated 14-3-3ζ regulation, in HEK293 cells
overexpressing 14-3-3ζ. Benzaldehyde significantly suppressed mTOR
pathway while it was not observed in parental HEK293 cells. Furthermore,
we performed pull down assay by using 14-3-3ζ GST tagged recombinant
proteins and lysates of HEK293T and BxPC3 and found that Benzaldehyde
treatment suppressed the interaction of 14-3-3ζ with cRaf, TSC2 and
other 14-3-3ζ client proteins. From these data, we confirmed that
Benzaldehyde is an inhibitor of the overexpressed 14-3-3ζ. Recent
reports have shown that 14-3-3ζ is overexpressed in many cancers and
acts as a signaling hub controlling the network of oncogenic pathways,
suggesting that overexpressed 14-3-3ζ associates with carcinogenesis,
metastasis and resistance for chemotherapy and radiation. Hence,
Benzaldehyde is considered to be a new molecular target agent of 14-3-3ζ
which promote and maintain cancer signals.
