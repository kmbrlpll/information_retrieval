Title: Potent antitumor activity of artemisinin.


Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and remains a therapeutic
enigma. Phytochemical compounds are emerging as a new generation of
anticancer agents with limited toxicity in cancer patients. The purpose
of this study was to investigate the potential impact of artemisinin, the
main active compound of the Chinese herb Artemisia annua L, on survival
cancer cells and tumor growth in vivo. Exposure of tumor cells P815
(murine mastocytoma) and BSR (kidney adenocarcinoma of hamster) to
increasing artemisinin concentrations resulted in a significant
inhibition of viability, as revealed by the respective IC50 values (12
µM for P815 and 52 µM for BSR cells). Interestingly, no cytotoxic
effect was observed of artemisinin on peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
The in vitro cytotoxicity studies were complemented by the determination
of apoptotic DNA fragmentation and Annexin V- Streptavidin-FITC assay.
Our results provide evidence that artemisinin leading to apoptotic
pathway on P815 but not on BSR cancer cell lines. Moreover, we
demonstrate that artemisinin synergizes with microtubule - damaging agent
vincristine to inhibit cellular viability. The in vivo anticancer
activity of artemisinin was also evaluated using the DBA2/P815 (H2d)
mouse model inoculated with the P815 mastocytoma cells. Our in vivo data
clearly showed that the oral administration of artemisinin inhibited
solid tumor development. In view of the available experimental findings,
we contend that artemisinin could have clinical potential as an
anticancer drug alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents such
as vincristine.
