Title: Overexpression of MYL5 promotes cervical cancer cell metastasis
through SLUG and HIF-1α signaling.


Myosin light chains (MLC) serve important regulatory functions in a wide
range of cellular and physiological processes. Previous research found
that MLC are also chromatin-associated nuclear proteins which regulate
gene transcription. In this study, we show that the MLC member myosin
regulatory light chain 5 (MYL5) controls metastasis in cervical cancer.
We uncover this role of MYL5 through clinical cervical cancer samples and
various in vitro and in vivo models of metastasis. MYL5 promotes
metastasis by enhancing the transcription of SLUG and hypoxia inducible
factor-1α (HIF-1α). Moreover, we reveal a bidirectional regulation
between MYL5 and HIF-1α. HIF-1α specifically binds to the MYL5 promoter
region, and hypoxia leads to increased levels of MYL5 in cervical
cancers. Overexpression of MYL5 sustained HIF-1α expression in normoxic
condition. Clinical data confirmed a positive correlation between MYL5
and HIF-1α. In summary, our observations suggest a potential application
of MYL5 in prognosis prediction and cancer treatment.
