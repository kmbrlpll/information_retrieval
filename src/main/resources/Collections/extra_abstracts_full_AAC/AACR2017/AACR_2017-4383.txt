Title: Novel fusion transcripts in colorectal cancer patients revealed by
next-generation RNA sequencing.


Although colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer
in the world, there is an insufficient research on molecular targets for
prevention and therapies of CRC. Gene fusions are associated with
tumorigenesis and tumor activation, and could be a standard to
distinguish tumor heterogeneity for personalized therapy. In the present
study, we performed next-generation RNA sequencing (150 tumor and 50
matched normal tissues) in order to discover novel fusion transcripts in
CRC. A total 25 transcript candidates were detected by GFP, deFuse, and
FusionMap algorithms. Among the candidates, 6 fusion transcripts were
selected (B4GALT1-BAG1, GTF3A-CDK8, NAGLU-IKZF3, RNF121-FOLR2, STRN-ALK,
and TAF4-NDRG3) after analyzing expression and function of the acceptor
genes. All of them were validated by sanger-sequencing and were not found
in another cohort. Overexpression of these fusion genes, except
B4GALT1-BAG1, increased proliferation of CRC cells. In addition,
overexpression of NAGLU-IKZF3 enhanced migration of CRC cells. These
results reveal novel fusion transcripts and their tumorigenic effects in
CRC. Ultimately, it could illuminate a genomic-driven strategy to develop
personalized medicine.
