Title: Metabolic reprogramming in acute myeloid leukemia cells by
mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes induces chemoresistance.


Mesenchymal stromal cells play an important role in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) development. Altered cellular metabolism supports AML
cells' survival in multiple aspects, such as drug resistance. Here, we
demonstrate the role of MSC-derived exosomes in metabolic regulation of
AML cells, and put forward a combinatorial strategy to sensitize AML
cells to chemodrugs. Exosomes secreted by MSCs can reprogram the
metabolic machinery following their internalization by AML cells. Through
13C tracing experiments and flux analysis, we elucidate that MSC-derived
exosomes enhance oxidative phosphorylation and glutamine's entry into TCA
cycle, which replenish the pool of carbon sources in mitochondria.
Further, our work shows that inhibiting the interactions between MSCs and
AML cells by targeting the metabolic regulation exerted by MSC-derived
exosomes sensitizes AML cells to chemodrugs. Taken together, our work
reveals a novel role of the TME in regulating the metabolic adaptation in
AML cells and uncovers the improved strategy for AML therapy.
