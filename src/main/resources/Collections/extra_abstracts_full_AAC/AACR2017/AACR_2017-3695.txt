Title: The interplay between neutrophils &It CDThe interplay between
neutrophils and CD8+ cell improves survival in human colorectal cancer.


Purpose: Tumor infiltration by different T lymphocyte subsets is known to
be associated with favorable prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Still
debated is the role of innate immune system. We investigated clinical
relevance, phenotypes &it functional features of CRC infiltrating CD66b+
neutrophils &it their crosstalk with CD8+ T cells.

Experimental design: CD66b+ &it CD8+ cell infiltration was analyzed by
immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray including >650 evaluable CRC
samples. Phenotypic profiles of tissue infiltrating and peripheral blood
CD66b+ cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. CD66b+/ CD8+ cells
crosstalk was investigated by in vitro experiments.

Results: CD66b+ cell infiltration in CRC is significantly associated with
increased survival. Interestingly, neutrophils frequently co-localize
with CD8+ T cells in CRC. Functional studies indicate that although
neutrophils are devoid of direct antitumor potential, co-culture with
peripheral blood or tumor associated neutrophils (TANs) enhances CD8+ T
cell activation, proliferation and cytokine release induced by suboptimal
concentrations of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Moreover, under
optimal activation conditions, CD8+ cells initially stimulated in the
presence of CD66b+ cells show decreased expression of PD-1
“exhaustion” marker and are significantly less susceptible to
apoptosis induced by T- cell receptor triggered re-stimulation.
Importantly, combined tumor infiltration by CD66b+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes
is associated with significantly better prognosis, as compared to CD8+ T
cell infiltration alone.

Conclusions: Neutrophils enhance the responsiveness of CD8+ T cells to
TCR triggering. Accordingly, infiltration by neutrophils enhances the
prognostic significance of CRC infiltration by CD8+ T cells, suggesting
that they might effectively promote antitumor immunity.
