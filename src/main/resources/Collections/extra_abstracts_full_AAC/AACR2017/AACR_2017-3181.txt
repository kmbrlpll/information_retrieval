Title: A novel topoisomerase IIα 90 kDa isoform in etoposide resistant
human leukemia K562 cells produced as a result of alternative RNA
processing.


DNA topoisomerase IIα (TOP2α) is a prominent target for anticancer
drugs whose clinical efficacy is often limited by chemoresistance. We
previously characterized acquired resistance to etoposide (VP-16) in a
cloned human K562 leukemia cell line, K/VP.5, containing reduced TOP2α.
In the present study, using an antibody specific for the amino-terminus
of TOP2α, immunoassays indicated the existence of two TOP2α isoforms,
170 and 90 kDa, present in K562 leukemia cells and in the etoposide
resistant K/VP.5 cells. TOP2α/90 expression was dramatically increased
in etoposide-resistant K/VP.5 compared to parental K562 cells. We
hypothesized that TOP2α/90 was the translation product of novel
alternatively processed pre-mRNA, confirmed by 3’-RACE, PCR, and
sequencing. TOP2α/90 mRNA includes retained intron 19 which harbors an
in-frame stop codon, and two consensus poly(A) sites. The processed
transcript is polyadenylated. TOP2α/90 mRNA encodes a 90,076 Da
translation product missing the carboxyl-terminal 770 amino acids of
TOP2α/170, replaced by 25 unique amino acids through translation of the
exon 19/intron 19 ‘readthrough’. Immunoassays, utilizing antisera
raised against these unique amino acids, confirmed that TOP2α/90 is
expressed in both cell types, with overexpression in K/VP.5 cells.
Immunodetection of Complex of Enzyme-to-DNA (ICE) and single cell gel
electrophoresis (Comet) assays demonstrated that K562 cells transfected
with a TOP2α/90 expression plasmid, exhibited reduced etoposide-mediated
TOP2α-DNA covalent complexes and decreased etoposide-induced DNA damage,
respectively, compared to similarly treated K562 cells transfected with
empty vector. Since TOP2α/90 lacks the active site tyrosine (Tyr805) of
full length TOP2α, these results strongly suggest that TOP2α/90
exhibits dominant-negative properties. . In separate studies the
TOP2α/90 mRNA splice variant was found to be expressed in most human
tissues suggesting that this novel protein isoform may play a role in
both intrinsic chemosensitivity as well as in acquired resistance.
Further studies are underway to characterize the mechanism(s) by which
TOP2α/90 plays a role in acquired resistance to etoposide and other
TOP2α targeting agents. In addition, future studies will be directed to
examine the RNA processing mechanism(s) operational that suppress intron
19 splicing in TOP2α pre-mRNA.
