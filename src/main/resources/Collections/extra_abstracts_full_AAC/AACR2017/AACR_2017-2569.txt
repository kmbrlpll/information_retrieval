Title: BCL6 promotes glioma and serves as a novel therapeutic target.


ZBTB transcription factors orchestrate gene transcription during tissue
development. However, their roles in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remain
unexplored. Here, through a functional screening of ZBTB genes, we
identify that BCL6 is required for GBM cell proliferation and is
overexpressed in GBM samples. Using a somatic transgenic mouse model,
Bcl6 confers the proliferative and invasive stimuli to glioma cells in
vivo. Moreover, we discover AXL as a novel downstream target of BCL6.
Through AXL, BCL6 enhances both MEK-ERK and S6K-RPS6 axes.
Pharmacological inhibition of BCL6 activity effectively blocks GBM growth
and inhibits AXL expression. Together, these findings uncover a novel
glioma-promoting role of BCL6, and provide the rationale of targeting
BCL6 as a potential therapeutic approach.
