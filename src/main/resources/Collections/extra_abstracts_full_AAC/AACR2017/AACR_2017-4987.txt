Title: ASS1 downregulation facilitates cancer cell survival in acidic
environment.


”pH gradient reversal”, namely the alkalinization of intracellular pH
(pHi) and acidification of extracellular pH (pHe), is a unique phenotype
of cancer cells which enable cancer survival, migration and invasion.
Hence, not surprisingly, pH gradient reversal is emerging as a new
hallmark of cancer. Argininosuccinate synthase, ASS1, is a urea cycle
enzyme found to be downregulated by methylation in multiple different
types of cancers in correlation with increased metastasis and poor
prognosis. We recently showed that ASS1 downregulation increases
proliferation by channeling aspartate towards pyrimidine synthesis by
CAD. We now show that under hypoxia and acidic environments, ASS1 is
downregulated together with CAD by HIF1α as part of an essential network
necessary for cancer cells’ survival, invasion and migration. Similar
to germline deficiency of ASS1 which increases the levels of glutamine
and ammonia, ASS1 downregulation by HIF1αenables the cancer cells to
increase glutamine levels allowing its utilization for glutathione and
importantly, for preservation of alkali pHi by elevating ammonia levels
and buffering the acidity caused by cancers’ enhanced glycolysis and
the consequent increase in lactic acid. Moreover, cancer cells which
express ASS1 when grown in culture, downregulate its expression in
hypoxic regions when grown in vivo, suggesting that these cancers might
also be sensitive to drugs previously utilized only in ASS1 deficient
cancers. Finally, we show that treating cancers with ASS1 deficiency with
ammonia scavengers as given to ASS1 deficient patients, increases
apoptosis and restricts migration, and is hence beneficial
therapeutically. In summary, ASS1 downregulation is regulated differently
at altered carcinogenic states, promoting proliferation as well as cancer
survival and metastasis.
