Title: Inhibitory effects of theaflavin-3, 3′-digallate (TF3) on
ovarian cancer cells.


Theaflavin-3, 3'-digallate (TF3) is a black tea polyphenol produced from
polymerization and oxidization of green tea ployphenols epicatechin
gallate and (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) during fermentation
of fresh tea leaves. TF3 has been reported to have anti-cancer
properties. However, the effect of TF3 on tumor angiogenesis and the
underlying mechanisms are not clear. In the current research, TF3 was
verified to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Compared with EGCG, TF3 was more
potent. TF3 inhibited human ovarian carcinoma OVCAR-3 cells induced
angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cell model and in chick
chorioallantoic membrane model. TF3 reduced tumor angiogenesis by
down-regulating HIF-1α and VEGF. One of the mechanisms was TF3
inactivated Akt/ mTOR/ p70S6K/ 4E-BP1 pathway and Akt/ c-Myc pathway.
Besides, TF3 suppressed the cleavage of Notch-1, subsequently decreased
the expression of c-Myc, HIF-1α and VEGF, and finally impaired cancer
cells induced angiogenesis. Nevertheless, TF3 didn’t have any influence
on MAPK pathways. Taken together, these findings suggest that TF3 might
serve as a potential anti-angiogenic agent for cancer treatment.
