Title: A comparative study of four PD-L1 immunohistochemical assay in
non-small cell lung cancer and evaluation of scoring system.


Background: Clinical trials of immune checkpoints modulators, including
both programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-ligand 1
(PD-L1) inhibitors, have recently shown promising activity and tolerable
toxicity in pre-treated and first line NSCLC patients. At least five
PD-L1 IHC assays with custom reagents and scoring-criteria are evaluated
in clinical trials. However, current assays for the prognostic and/or
predictive role of tumor PD-L1 expression are not standardized and the
role of PD-L1 expression as a biomarker is still controversial.

Materials and Methods: Retrospectively collected formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded whole-tissue sections (WTS) from 97 NSCLC cases from
Seoul National University Bundang Hospital were obtained. We tested the
samples divided “training set” and “validation set”: A set of 50
NSCLC WTS (32 adenocarcinoma and 18 squamous cell carcinoma) resected
from 2010 to 2011 was designated “training set” and the other set of
47 NSCLC WTS (32 adenocarcinoma, 14 squamous cell carcinoma, and 1
pleomorphic carcinoma) resected from 2015 to 2016 was designated
“validation set”. We examined PD-L1 protein expression using four
different antibodies (Clone E1L3N, SP142, SP263 and 22C3) using Ventana
XT platform with optiview detection kit for E1L3N, SP142 and SP263, and
DAKO link 46 platform with pharmDx kit for 22C3 by immunohistochemical
analysis. Staining of tumor cells (Tumor proportion score, TPS) and
immune cells were evaluated.

Results: PD-L1 protein expression was observed in 18 %, 16%, 11% and 12%
of total tumors with E1L3N with Ventana optiview kit (5% cutoff), SP142
with Ventana optiview kit with amplification (1% cutoff), SP263 with
Ventana optiview kit (25% cutoff) and 22C3 with DAKO PharmDx kit (50%
cufoff), respectively. There was no different positive rate between
“training” and “validation” set, which means there was no effect
of the age of paraffin block on PD-L1 expression. Regarding staining
proportion of tumor cells, 22C3 yields more stained tumor cells (highest
TPS) and SP142 consistently labels fewer tumor cells (lowest TPS). Among
38 cases which were positive in one or more assays, 28.9% showed
discrepant results for PD-L1 expression between the assays according to
each criterion. When the same criterion applied for all assays,
discrepant rate is higher (63.1 % with 1% cutoff, 71.0% with 5% cutoff).

Conclusion: Although comparative determination of PD-L1 protein levels in
NSCLC reveals inter-assay variability of tumor cell staining, positive
rate is similar under each criterion. Therefore, there is a potential for
different diagnostic results according to the key clinical cut-offs if
assays and algorithms are mismatched and we should be careful when
interpret the PD-L1 expression with different assays.
