Title: TRAF1 is required for solar UV-induced skin carcinogenesis.


Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) is a member of
the TRAF protein family, which regulates the canonical and non-canonical
NF-ÎºB signaling cascades. Although aberrant TRAF1 expression in tumors
is reported, the role of TRAF1 remains elusive. Here, we report that
TRAF1 is required for skin carcinogenesis induced by chronic solar UV
radiation. In vivo studies with solar UV exposure indicate that the
deletion of TRAF1 results in the inhibition of AP-1 activity by
down-regulating the induction of c-Fos and c-Jun by regulating ERK5
activity. Furthermore, we show that TRAF1 is required for solar
UV-induced ERK5 activation. Mechanistic studies revealed that TRAF1
expression enhances the ubiquitination of ERK5 on K184, which is
necessary for AP-1 activation. Altogether, our results suggest that TRAF1
mediates ERK5 activity by regulating the upstream effectors of ERK5 and
also by modulating its ubiquitination status. Targeting TRAF1 function
might lead to strategies for preventing and treating skin cancer.
