Title: Structural and biochemical characterization of membrane bound KRAS.


KRAS4b functions as a molecular switch cycling between an active GTP
bound state and inactive GDP state. Active KRAS4b binds tightly to RAF1
via its Ras binding domain (RBD), however activation of RAF1 competent
for MAPK signal transduction requires membrane bound KRAS4b. Using
recombinant farnesylated and methylated KRAS4b (KRAS4b-FMe) we have used
a variety of biophysical methodologies including paramagnetic relaxation
enhancement NMR, neutron reflectivity, small angle neutron and x-ray
scattering and protein footprinting to gain insights into the orientation
and structure of KRAS-FMe bound to a membrane. In these experiments we
have used Nanodiscs or tethered lipid bilayers composed of
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline or -serine (70% POPC
30% POPS). Our data indicate that KRAS-FMe is oriented perpendicular to
the membrane with minimal direct contacts to the membrane. The nucleotide
bound state does not significantly change the orientation relative to the
membrane. We will also present data on the effect of the RBD domain of
RAF1 binding to KRAS-FMe at the membrane.
