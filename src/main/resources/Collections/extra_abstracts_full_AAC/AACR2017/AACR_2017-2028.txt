Title: PDE3A modulation for cancer therapy.


In a differential cytotoxicity screen, we identified a novel small
molecule modulator of phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) that kills cancer
cells expressing elevated levels of PDE3A and SLFN12 (de Waal, Nat Chem
Biol, 2016). Treatment with this cell-selective cytotoxic small molecule,
DNMDP, induces complex formation between PDE3A and SLFN12, resulting in
apoptosis. Inhibition of PDE3A enzymatic activity is not sufficient for
cancer cell killing, and expression of both PDE3A and SLFN12 are
required. Although the mechanism of signaling to the apoptosis machinery
remains unclear, we examined more closely the role of the PDE3A-SLFN12
complex in cancer cell killing mediated by DNMDP. We found that cancer
cell lines made resistant to DNMDP by persistent exposure downregulated
SLFN12 expression and that re-expression of SLFN12 was sufficient to
restore sensitivity. Furthermore, ectopic expression of PDE3A and SLFN12
are sufficient to sensitize cancer cells to DNMDP. These data underscore
the tight correlation of PDE3A-SLFN12 complex formation and cancer cell
killing mediated by DNMDP.
