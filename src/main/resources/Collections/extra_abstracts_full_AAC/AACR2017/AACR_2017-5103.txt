Title: Development of MJ-66 as a novel anticancer agent for the treatment
of malignant gliomas.


Malignant glioma is the most common aggressive adult primary tumor of the
central nervous system. Treatments of malignant gliomas include surgery,
radiotherapy and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. However,
inherent- and acquired resistance to TMZ present major obstacles to
successful treatment, and the prognosis of patients with malignant
gliomas remains very poor.

MJ-66, a synthetic qunazoline compound, was identified in our study as a
potent anti-proliferative agent especially on human glioma with IC50 of
approximately 60 nM. In intracranial glioma xenograft model, MJ-66 (0.14
mg/kg in saline, i.p., q.d., 10 days) significantly inhibited tumor
growth and increased the survival of the experimental mice, however, did
not decrease the body weight of mice.

Currently, there is a profound unmet medical need for a new drug in the
treatment of malignant brain tumor. The MJ-66 demonstrated superior
efficacy to TMZ that are the only first-line-drug in clinical use. MJ-66
is suggested to be a promising anticancer candidate.
