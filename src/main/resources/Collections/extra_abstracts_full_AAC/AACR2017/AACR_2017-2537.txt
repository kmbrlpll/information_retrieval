Title: MicroRNA targeting anti-apoptotic and G2/M pathways as therapeutic
targets for castration resistant prostate cancer.


Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers in men.
Unfortunately, limited treatment options currently exist for those who
have developed advanced castration-resistant PC (CRPC). G-1 is a
GPER1/GPR30 agonist, and a promising candidate for CRPC therapy. G-1 is
effective in halting the growth of CR tumors but not those grown in
intact hosts. These findings suggest GPER1 is a therapeutic target for
CRPC. We found that G-1, through activation of GPER1, inhibited growth of
CRPC cells via cell-cycle arrest at the G2-M phase, probably leading to
mitotic catastrophy. However, the exact mode of action of G-1 was not
known. To better understand the pathways involved in G-1 action, we
conducted a genome-wide mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq study on G-1 treated
xenografts. We identified a panel of novel G-1-associated tumor
suppressive miRNAs and genes. Moreover, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
revealed that the G-1 differentially regulated genes are involved in
“Cellular Growth and Proliferation”, “endocrine function” and
“Cancer” pathways. We validated the expression of the key miRNA
(miR-34c, miR-10b, miR-138 and miR218) and genes in G-1 treated
castration resistant xenografts and cell lines (C4-2 and 22Rv1).
Furthermore, we have shown the tumor suppressor function of these miRNA
in cell survival, migration, and invasion. The predicted target genes
were next examined for decreased expression by qRT-PCR. We confirmed
decreased expression of some of the downstream targets, which consist of
genes involved in cell cycle regulation (CCNA and CCND, CDK1, CDK4,
PLK1), cell survival (Bcl2, Survivin), cell migration/F-actin formation
(LASP, PCDH7, ITGA9, ROBO1, SLIT1) and G2/M checkpoint (CDK1, PLK1, BCL-2
Survivin). Thus these miRNAs - miR-34c, miR-10b, miR-138 and miR218 - are
ideal candidates for therapy of CRPC.
