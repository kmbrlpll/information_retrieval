Title: Context-dependent role of ARF for response to chemotherapy in
muscle invasive bladder cancer.


Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a significant cause of cancer
death, in part because there are relatively few treatments and these have
limited efficacy. Our studies show that expression of 14ARF (aka ARF),
one of the major transcripts encoded by the CDKN2A tumor suppressor
locus, is frequently up-regulated in MIBC, particularly in more
aggressive disease subtypes. Our results further show that accumulation
of ARF protein in the nucleolus is associated with poor outcome and
reduced response to chemotherapy. Using both genetically-engineered mouse
(GEM) models and human xenograft models of MIBC, we demonstrate that
tumors expressing ARF display poor response to treatment with the
platinum-based chemotherapy agent cisplatin. This is mediated in part by
expression of the integrin-binding protein ITGB3BP (CENPR) and reflects
ARF-dependent inhibition of protein translation, which is attenuated by
drug treatment. Our findings reveal an unexpected context-dependent role
for ARF in modulating drug response in bladder cancer through its ability
to regulate protein translation.
