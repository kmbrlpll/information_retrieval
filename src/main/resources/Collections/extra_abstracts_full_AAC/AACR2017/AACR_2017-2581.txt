Title: VGLL4 suppresses the human breast cancer progression through the
inhibition of YAP oncogenic function.


VGLL4 is a Vestigial-like (VGLL) protein that is deregulated in various
types of cancer. However, the functions of VGLL4 in breast cancer remain
largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that VGLL4 expression positively
correlates with survival for breast cancer patients. The overexpression
of VGLL4 in breast cancer cells reduced cell proliferation, colony
formation, cell migration and invasion in vitro and inhibited tumor
growth in vivo. We found that the 2nd TEAD-interacting domain (TDU2) of
VGLL4 is involved in interactions between VGLL4 and the transcription
factor TEAD and that the deletion of this domain completely abolished the
phenotype induced by VGLL4 overexpression. Interestingly, RNAseq analysis
indicated that VGLL4 overexpression not only inhibits YAP targets but
also activates the TGF-Î² and Notch signaling pathways. Our study
provides evidence of the tumor-suppressive effects of VGLL4 on breast
cancer progression and suggests that VGLL4 and its TDU2 domain may become
promising and efficient therapeutic targets for delaying the development
of breast cancer and improving patient survival.
