Title: The dynamic interplay between the cancer genome mutating enzyme
APOBEC3B and DNA substrates.


The APOBEC3 (A3) family of enzymes catalyze deamination of cytosines to
uracils (C-to-U) in single-stranded (ss)DNA, and is an important part of
innate immune responses against viruses and transposons. Recent data also
indicate that APOBEC3B (A3B) is a major source of genomic mutations in
multiple cancers and a contributor to the evolution of drug resistance.
A3B is therefore a promising anti-cancer target. Using existing
structural information and structural modeling, we generated a model for
wild-type A3B in complex with ssDNA and used molecular dynamics to
monitor the dynamics of the native interactions of wild-type A3B with
ssDNA. The details of A3B-ssDNA interaction and its implications for
potential inhibitor design will be presented.
