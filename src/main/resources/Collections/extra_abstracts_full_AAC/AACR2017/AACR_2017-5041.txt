Title: Translational pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic xenograft model for
TAK-931, a small molecule cell division cycle 7 (CDC7) kinase inhibitor.


TAK-931 is a small molecule inhibitor of the cell division cycle 7 (CDC7)
kinase. As a serine/threonine kinase that contributes to DNA replication
and the DNA damage response, CDC7 is hypothesized to be a promising
cancer drug target. CDC7 inhibition with TAK-931 has demonstrated
antiproliferative activity with cancer cell lines and tumor growth
inhibition (TGI) in murine ectopic xenograft models. Herein, the analysis
of multiple models to characterize pharmacokinetic (PK) and
pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships with xenograft TGI is described.
TAK-931 treatment-induced TGI was dose schedule-independent and could be
described using plasma drug concentrations or tumor PD inhibition.
However, the efficacious doses were at least 10-fold higher for the
PK-TGI relationship than for the PD-TGI relationship. This discrepancy
was used to select a dynamic PK-PD-TGI modeling approach to project the
minimal efficacious dose (MED) and minimal biological active dose (MBAD)
for TAK-931 due to the large differences in time-concentration profiles
predicted for humans versus mice. The Phase I human trial is on-going and
will be used to verify the dynamic PK-PD-driven modeling approach for the
CDC7 inhibitor.
