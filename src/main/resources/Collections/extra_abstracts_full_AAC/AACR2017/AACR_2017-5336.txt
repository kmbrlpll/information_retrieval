Title: Characterization of selective covalent inhibitors of USP7.


The ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) has emerged as an attractive
therapeutic target owing to its critical roles in several cancer
signaling pathways as well as its essential role in maintaining Foxp3+
T-regulatory cell (Treg) functions. Pharmacological inhibition of USP7
using Progenraâ€™s small molecule inhibitors resulted in direct
anti-tumor activity as well as the unleashing of anti-tumor immunity by
suppressing Treg functions. However, the precise mechanism of action
these compounds was not well characterized. Using a combination of NMR
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single amino acid substitution
approaches, we have now demonstrated that our USP7 inhibitors
specifically target the catalytic cleft of USP7 and covalently modify its
active site cysteine (Cys223). Pharmacokinetic studies revealed sustained
irreversible USP7 inhibition after short term inhibitor treatment as well
as subsequent changes in the level and ubiquitylation of various
pharmacodynamic markers, including the Treg lineage specific
transcription factor Foxp3. Detailed knowledge of the mechanism of USP7
inhibition has allowed us to incorporate rational design strategies into
the lead optimization to obtain improved

molecules that will serve as the basis of a new class of anti-cancer
immunotherapy agents.
