Title: Targeted human cytolytic fusion proteins: an update.


Targeted immunotherapeutics, such as antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) or
immunotoxins (ITs) represent promising agents for treatment of cancer.
Despite their encouraging performance in clinical trials, both ADCs and
ITs suffer from disadvantages like stoichiometrically undefined chemical
linkage of the cytotoxic payload and potential immunogenicity of
bacteria- or plant-derived toxins in humans, respectively. Therefore, in
contrast to depleting B cell epitopes from bacterial toxins, we designed
a number of targeted recombinant cytolytic fusion proteins, replacing
bacterial toxins like Pseudomonas exotoxin A by human enzymes like
proteases, kinases, RNases or microtubuli-associated proteins. Binding
and biological activities were shown in vitro, ex vivo and in different
in vivo models. This presentation will summarize the latest results on
the hCFPs generated and demonstrate the efficacy of treatment of CD64-,
CSPG4-, and EpCAM-targeting constructs in direct comparison to the
corresponding Pseudomonas exotoxin-based immunotoxins. The presentation
will conclude with an outlook on future perspective and applications of
the next generation of targeted fully human recombinant cytolytic fusion
proteins.
