Title: Structural, thermodynamics and kinetics role of novel hot-spot
mutations of BCR-ABL1 in resistance towards "Ibs" inhibitors.


The present contribution integrates structural, computational, and
molecular biology techniques to understand the eventual role of our newly
reported hot-spot mutations of the BCR-ABL1 KD in TKI resistance observed
in CML patients (1) using a "two-tier level" investigation: isolated KDs
and SH2-liker-SH3-KD BCR-ABL1 constructs.

Specifically, in silico experiments will disclose the effects exerted by
the “hot-spot” BCR-ABL1 mutations on the protein structure,
thermodynamic stability, and ability to interfere with BCR-ABL1 binding
to specific TKIs (e.g., imatinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib).

Structural biology (e.g., SAXS) evidences of wild type and mutant
isolated KDs and SH2-linker-SH3-KD (SSK) constructs (per se and in
complex with TKIs) will be discussed to support in silico predictions.
Direct drug binding thermodynamics and kinetics to both KD and SSK
constructs will be measured using isothermal titration calorimetry and
surface plasmon resonance.

In vitro kinase assays will monitor the ability of these mutant isoforms
to auto-phosphorylate and to phosphorylate a substrate peptide.
