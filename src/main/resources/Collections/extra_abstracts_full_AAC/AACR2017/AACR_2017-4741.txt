Title: Biomarker significance of plasma and tumor miR-21, miR-221, and
miR-106a in pediatric osteosarcoma.


Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and
young adults. Despite the use of surgery and multi-agent chemotherapy,
osteosarcoma patients who respond poorly towards chemotherapy or develop
relapses have a dismal outcome. Identification of biomarkers for active
disease may help to monitor tumor burden, detect early relapses, and
predict prognosis in these patients, so that they can be treated as early
as possible to improve their survival. In this study, we examined if
circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) can be used as biomarkers in osteosarcoma
patients. We performed genome-wide miRNA profiling on a discovery cohort
of OS plasma samples (n=32) collected from the Texas Children’s
Hospital. A total of 56 miRNAs were upregulated and 164 miRNAs were
downregulated in osteosarcoma samples when compared to normal plasma
samples (n=8). miRNA-21, miR-221 and miRNA-106a were selected for further
validation based on their known biological importance. We showed that all
three circulating miRNAs were expressed significantly higher in OS
samples (n=29) than normal samples (n=17) in an independent cohort
obtained from the Children’s Oncology Group. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that miR-21 was expressed significantly higher in
osteosarcoma tumors (n=89) compared with normal bone controls. More
importantly, lower expressions of miR-21 and miR-221, but not miR-106a,
significantly correlated with a poor outcome. In conclusion, our results
indicate that miR-21, miR-221 and miR-106a are elevated in the
circulation of osteosarcoma patients, whereas tumor expressions of miR-21
and miR-221 are prognostically significant. Further investigation of the
miRNAs may lead to a better prognostic method and potential miRNA
therapeutics for osteosarcoma.
