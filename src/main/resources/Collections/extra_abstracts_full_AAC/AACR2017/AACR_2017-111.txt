Title: Targeting STAT3 and telomerase for the treatment of colorectal
cancer.


There is an increasing evidence of pro-inflammatory cytokines involvement
in cancer development. Here, we found that two cytokines, IL-6 and
TNF-α, induced colorectal cancer cells more active and invasive.
Combined treatments of IL-6 and TNF-α phosphorylated transcription
factors STAT3 in a synergistic manner. STAT3 and NF-ҡB physically
interacted upon cytokine stimulation. Similarly, STAT1 hetero-dimerized
with STAT3 and the binding affinity was enhanced with cytokine
treatments. STAT3 bound the promoter region of human telomerase reverse
transcriptase (hTERT), and IL-6 and TNF-α stimulation further enhanced
this STAT3 binding affinity. Withaferin A, an anti-inflammatory steroidal
lactone, inhibited the IL-6 and TNF-α induced cancer cell invasiveness
and decreased colonosphere formation. Notably, withaferin A inhibited
STAT3 phosphorylation and abolished the STAT3 and NF-ҡB interactions.
STAT3 binding to hTERT promoter was inhibited and telomerase activity was
decreased with the withaferin A treatments. Taken together,
pro-inflammatory cytokines induced-cancer cell invasiveness is mediated
by STAT3 regulated mechanism in colorectal cancer cells. Our study
suggests the novel natural compound therapy for the metastatic colorectal
cancer in clinical settings.
