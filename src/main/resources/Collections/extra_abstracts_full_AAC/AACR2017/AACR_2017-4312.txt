Title: Targeting FoxM1 in inducing anticancer effects in triple-negative
breast cancer cells.


Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly aggressive and a major
threat to survival due to absence of molecular targets. Invasion,
metastasis and chemoresistance are the greatest obstacles to the
successful tumor treatment in breast cancer patients. In this study,
over-expression of Forkhead box transcription factor M1 (FoxM1) was
observed in 79% (770/975) of breast cancers from Saudi Arabia. FoxM1
over-expression was found to be an independent prognostic marker in
multivariate analysis in late stage (Stage 3 and 4) breast cancer
(p=0.0110). Our in vitro results show that treatment with thiostrepton, a
dual FoxM1 and proteasome inhibitor caused cell viability loss and induce
apoptosis in a dose dependent manner in triple-negative breast cancer
cell lines. Thiostrepton treatment also inhibited colony formation and
invasion/migration capabilities of triple-negative breast cancer cells.
In vivo, thiostrepton treatment regressed TNBC cells; MDA-MB-231
generated xenografts via down-regulation of FoxM1 and its downstream
targets. Altogether, our results suggest that FoxM1 and its associated
signaling pathway may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention
in the treatment of aggressive breast cancer.
