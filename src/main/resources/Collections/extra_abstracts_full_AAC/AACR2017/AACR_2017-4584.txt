Title: High PD-1 expression on regulatory and effector T cells in lung
cancer draining lymph nodes.


The treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with PD-1
immune checkpoint inhibitors has improved clinical outcome for a
proportion of patients. The current challenge is to find biomarkers that
will identify patients likely to benefit from this therapy. In this study
we assessed the difference of T cell subsets and PD-1 expression levels
on T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN), non-TDLN (NTDLN) and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

To evaluate this, flow cytometric analyses were performed on
endobronchial ultrasound-guided (EBUS) fine-needle aspirates (FNA) from
TDLN and NTDLN of patients with NSCLC and compared to PBMC.

Our data show that the frequency of PD-1+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well
as the PD-1 expression level on activated regulatory T (aTreg) and CD4+
and CD8+ T cells, are higher in TDLNs as compared to NTDLNs or PBMC.

These elevated PD-1 expression levels in TDLN may reflect tumor-specific
T cell priming and may serve as a predictive or early response biomarker
during PD-1 checkpoint blockade.
