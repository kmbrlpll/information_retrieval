Title: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) release exosomal microRNAs
that dictate an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer.


Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major components of the tumor
microenvironment may drive tumor progression. Exosomes mediate horizontal
transfer of miRs, mRNAs and proteins, thus affecting breast cancer
progression. Differential expression profile analysis identified three
miRs increased in exosomes from CAFs as compared from normal fibroblasts.
Immunofluorescence indicated that exosomes may be transferred from CAFs
to breast cancer cells, releasing their cargo miRs. Breast cancer cells
exposed to CAF exosomes or transfected with those miRs exhibited a
significant increased capacity to form mammospheres, increased stem cell
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, and
anchorage-independent cell growth. These effects were reverted by
transfection with anti-miRs. Similarly to CAF exosomes, normal fibroblast
exosomes transfected with CAFs-miRs promoted the stemness and EMT
phenotype of breast cancer cells. Thus, we provided evidence of the role
of CAF exosomes and their miRs in the induction of the stemness and EMT
phenotype in different breast cancer cell lines.
