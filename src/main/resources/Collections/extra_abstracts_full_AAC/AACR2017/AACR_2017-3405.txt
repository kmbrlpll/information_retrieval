Title: Screening for two recurrent BRCA1 mutations in Tunisian women with
triple negative breast cancer.


Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) lack expression of oestrogen,
progesterone and HER2 receptors. Reports to date indicate that up to 20 %
of TNBC patients harbour germline BRCA mutations; however, the prevalence
of mutations may vary with ethnic group and with geographic region. In
the Tunisian population, as yet a limited number of BRCA germline
mutations have been reported. Tow recurrent mutations were found in exon
5 and 20 in BRCA1 gene (c.211dupA and c.5266dupC).

To investigate the contribution of BRCA1 gene mutations to TNBC in
Tunisia, we screened the exons 5 and 20 of BRCA1 gene in 20 TNBC patients
by direct sequencing.

In our study, we identified the c.5266dupC mutation in BRCA1 exon 20 in 2
of 20 triple-negative patients with a prevalence of 10%.

Our study is the first investigation on the role of BRCA1 gene in TNBC in
Tunisia. In this study, we show that targeting only the exon 20 in BRCA1
gene allows detection of a substantial percentage of mutations in
Tunisian TNBC patients.
