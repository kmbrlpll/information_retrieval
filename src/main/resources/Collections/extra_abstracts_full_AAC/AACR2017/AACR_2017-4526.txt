Title: Attenuation of hypoxia in solid tumor with multifunctional
upconversion nanoparticles to enhance photodynamic therapy.


As a non-invasive therapeutic technique, photodynamic therapy (PDT)
requires sufficient oxygen in order to generate adequate singlet oxygen
upon the excitation of photosensitizer using an appropriate light
wavelength. It has limited efficacy in preexisting hypoxia in tumor and
PDT-induced hypoxia, owing to the limit oxygen level in the tissue and
the consumption of the oxygen during the PDT treatment. Herein, taking
advantage of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), multifunctional upconversion
nanovehicle is constructed to overcome the above-mentioned problems. HBO
provides timely oxygen supply during the treatment, which greatly
enhances the photodynamic effect of the loaded nanoparticles, as
demonstrated by the accelerated generation of 1O2 and elevated
cytotoxicity. Tumor growth is greatly regressed in the HBO-PDT treated
mice. Our finding provides new insights into the modulation of
unfavourable tumor microenvironment with the perfect marriage between HBO
and NIR-light sensitized upconversion nanoparticles to overcome the
current limitation of cancer photodynamic therapies.
