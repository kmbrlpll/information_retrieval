Title: Targeting epigenetic modifiers in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.


Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, accounting for approximately 40% of all cases
worldwide. In the last five years, researchers uncovered that DLBCL is
characterized by widespread epigenetic deregulation. Lymphoma cells
harbor loss-of-function mutations in transcriptional activators (KMT2D,
EP300, CREBBP) and gain-of-function mutations in transcriptional
repressors (EZH2). In our study, we aim to identify epigenetic
vulnerabilities in lymphoma cells that can be targeted to deliver
cytotoxic responses. We screened the therapeutic efficacy of a panel of
lysine and arginine methyltransferase inhibitors in multiple lymphoma
cell lines. Through these screens, we identified the Type I Protein
Arginine Methyltransferase (PRMT) family as an attractive therapeutic
target that induced cytotoxicity. Mechanistic dissection revealed that
Type I PRMT inhibition caused apoptosis through deregulation of
transcription factors and pro-survival genes. In addition, we uncovered
novel crosstalk between PRMTs and other epigenetic modifiers that
influenced cell fate in lymphoma. Our study demonstrates a critical role
for Type I PRMTs in DLBCL, and adds a lucrative target to the growing
list of promising epigenetics-based therapies.
