Title: Mechanistic insights into phosphoinositide 3-kinase α.


Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are at the center of mTOR pathway that
plays key roles in regulating cell survival, proliferation, protein
synthesis and vesicle trafficking. Dysregulation of the mTOR pathway has
been implicated in various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis,
inflammation and respiratory illnesses. PI3Ks have dual kinase
specificity with a lipid kinase activity that phosphorylates the
3’-hydroxyl of phosphoinositides, and a protein kinase activity
including auto-phosphorylation. In this study, we explored the roles of
residues of the catalytic domain and regulatory subunit of human PI3Kα
in the lipid and protein phosphorylation. We used site-directed
mutagenesis and kinetic assays to precisely map the molecular basis of
substrate recognition and catalysis in PI3Kα. Kinetic analysis of K776,
located in the P-loop of PI3Kα, reveals that a lysine at this position
is essential for the recognition of the lipid and ATP substrates. This
same residue plays an important role in the auto-phosphorylation of the
enzyme. Replacement of histidine residues–H936 and H917 in the
activation and catalytic loops respectively with alanine residues results
in a dramatic change in the kinetics of PI3Kα. While H936A inactivates
the lipid kinase activity without affecting auto-phosphorylation, H917A
abolishes both the lipid and protein kinase activities of PI3Kα. On the
basis of kinetic and structural analysis, we proposed possible
mechanistic roles of these critical residues in catalysis.
