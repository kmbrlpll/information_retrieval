Title: Design and synthesis of indole derivatives as ABCG2 mediated
resistance reversal agents.


Multidrug resistance is a phenomenon that cancer cells become resistant
to anticancer drugs. Multidrug resistance has been shown to be related
with the overexpression of ATP-binding (ABC) transporters, including
ABCG2. Therefore, ABCG2 is a therapeutic target for the development of
multidrug resistance reversal agents. Fumitremorgin C, with an indole
group which is an important pharmacophore in many drugs, is a known ABCG2
inhibitor. Inspired by this, we synthesized two series of indole
derivatives as ABCG2 mediated resistance reversal agents. With MTT assay,
we found that two compounds from the two series of indole derivatives
respectively exhibited good reversal activity against ABCG2. The two
compounds did not significantly alter the expression of ABCG2 in
ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines and they stimulated the basal ATP
hydrolysis of ABCG2.
