Title: Glioma derived cancer stem cells are hypersensitive to proteasomal
inhibition.


Although proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are used as anticancer drugs to
treat various cancers, their relative therapeutic efficacy on stem cells
vs. bulk cancers remains unknown. Here, we show that stem cells derived
from gliomas, GSCs, are up to 1,000-fold more sensitive to PIs (IC50,
27-70 nM) compared with their differentiated controls (IC50, 47->>100
µM). The stemness of GSCs correlates to increased ubiquitination, whose
misregulation readily triggers apoptosis. PI-induced apoptosis of GSCs is
independent of NFκB but involves the phosphorylation of JNK as well as
the transcriptional activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress-associated proapoptotic mediators. In contrast to the general
notion that ER stress-associated apoptosis is signaled by prolonged
unfolded protein response (UPR), GSC-selective apoptosis is instead
counteracted by the UPR. ATF3 is a key mediator in GSC-selective
apoptosis. Pharmaceutical uncoupling of the UPR from its downstream
apoptosis sensitizes GSCs to PIs in vitro and during tumorigenesis in
mice. Thus, a combinational treatment of a PI with an inhibitor of
UPR-coupled apoptosis may enhance targeting of stem cells in gliomas.
