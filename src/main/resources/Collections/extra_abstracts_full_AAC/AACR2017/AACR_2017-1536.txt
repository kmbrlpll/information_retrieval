Title: CRISPR/Cas9 biased mutagenesis in the mouse genome: Is it useful
or harmful for cancer therapeutics.


Advances in CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing have provided unprecedented
opportunities to interrogate the functional significance of any given
genomic site. While this technology is rapidly spreading and extended to
with almost 4,000 PubMed entries as of today, there is a paucity of data
on the extent of unexpected and undesired molecular consequences
established upon targeting the mouse genome. We have introduced deletions
at more than 20 genomic sites including CTCF and STAT5 transcription
factor binding sites, screened over 500 founder mice and established and
analyzed more than 50 lines. These data sets revealed hitherto unknown
deletion patterns, unexpected large deletions using single sgRNAs and the
consistent deletion of sequences bridging distant loci that were targeted
simultaneously. Our findings provide guidelines for the application of
CRISPR/Cas9 in the mouse germline and provide the insight into designing
CRISPR-based cancer therapeutics.
