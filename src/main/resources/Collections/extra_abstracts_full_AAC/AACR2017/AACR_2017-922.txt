Title: Delta133p53 represses p53-inducible senescence genes and enhances
the generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells.


p53 functions to induce cellular senescence and apoptosis, which can be
incompatible with self-renewal of pluripotent stem cells such as induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and embryonic stem cells (ESC). On the
other hand, p53 regulates DNA damage response and repair and thus plays
an essential role in maintaining genomic integrity and suppressing
malignant transformation in iPSC and ESC. It remains to be elucidated
whether and how p53 and its regulators contribute to balanced regulation
between the self-renewing capacity and the genomic and functional
integrity in these pluripotent stem cells. We hypothesized the
involvement of Δ133p53, a physiological p53 protein isoform that
inhibits the activity of full-length p53 (FL-p53), and here examined 12
lines of human iPSC and their original fibroblasts, as well as 3 human
ESC lines, for endogenous protein levels of Δ133p53 and FL-p53, and mRNA
levels of p53 target genes of different functions. While FL-p53 levels in
iPSC and ESC widely ranged from below to above those in the fibroblasts,
all iPSC and ESC lines expressed elevated levels of Δ133p53. The
p53-inducible genes that mediate cellular senescence (e.g., p21WAF1 and
miR-34a), but not those for apoptosis and DNA repair, were downregulated
in iPSC and ESC. Consistent with these endogenous expression profiles,
overexpression of Δ133p53 in human fibroblasts preferentially repressed
the p53-inducible senescence mediators and significantly enhanced their
reprogramming to iPSC. The iPSC clones derived from
Δ133p53-overexpressing fibroblasts, when injected into immunodeficient
mice, formed well-differentiated, benign teratomas, suggesting that
Δ133p53 overexpression is non- or less oncogenic than total inhibition
of p53 activities. Overexpressed Δ133p53 prevented FL-p53 from binding
to the regulatory regions of p21WAF1 and miR-34a, providing a mechanistic
basis for its dominant-negative inhibition. This study supports the
hypothesis that upregulation of ∆133p53 is an endogenous mechanism that
facilitates human somatic cells to become pluripotent without malignant
transformation.
