Title: Radiotherapy-induced damage to cancer-associated fibroblasts and
its reciprocal influence on cancer progression: Impact of soluble factors.


Preoperative radiotherapy is a mainstay in current management of
colorectal cancer. Several tumor types, including colorectal cancer, show
an abundant desmoplastic stroma, characterized by cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs). Nevertheless the effects of radiation to the CAFs in
the stroma and its reciprocal impact on the response of CRC cells to
irradiation have not been studied. We investigated the functional (cell
number, morphotype) and biochemical (transcriptomics, metabolomics and
kinomics) phenotype of CRC cells in response to paracrine signals from
irradiated CAFs. Using neutralizing antibodies and small molecule
inhibitors, we analysed the role of tyrosine-kinase receptor activation
in CRC cells in response to supernatants from irradiated CAFs.
Furthermore, the impact of tyrosine-kinase receptor neutralization in
combination with RT was evaluated in an orthotopic CRC model. The level
of mTOR activation, a downstream tyrosine-kinase receptor intermediate,
was analysed in response to neoadjuvant treatment in human CRC specimens.
Further work will reveal which soluble factor(s) are implicated in the
communication between irradiated CAFs and colorectal cancer cells.
