Title: Haplotypes of chromosome 17q21.31 affect liver metastasis by small
intestinal neuroendocrine tumors.


Neuroendocrine tumors are the most common tumors of the small intestine.
Very little is known about genetic changes that cause SI-NETs, which have
a very low frequency of mutations. SI-NETs are highly metastatic to the
liver, and patients with liver metastases have a five year survival rate
of less than 50%. Caucasian patients are more likely to develop
metastasis than patients of other races. We have studied a 900 kB
inversion at chromosome 17q21.31, which is common to Caucasians but rare
in other races. Within a collection of 117 Caucasian patients with ileal
carcinoids, patients with the inversion haplotype were significantly less
likely to have liver metastasis. A second Caucasian-specific haplotype in
this region, beta2, was also tested for potential association with
metastasis of ileal carcinoids. Unlike the inversion haplotype, beta2
associates with increased metastasis of ileal carcinoids. We suspect that
the fact that the metastasis-promoting beta2 haplotype is more common
among Caucasians than the metastasis-suppressing inversion haplotype (44%
incidence vs. 33% incidence) is probably why Caucasians wind up with a
higher frequency of metastasis than races that carry neither beta2 nor
the inversion.
