Title: Detection of low-frequency somatic variants using single-molecule,
real-time sequencing.


Detection of somatic mutations, especially in heterogeneous tumor samples
where variants may be present at a low level, is challenging. Single
Molecule, Real-Time (SMRTÂ®) Sequencing is ideal for minor variant
detection because of its ability to sequence single molecules with very
high accuracy (>QV40) using the circular consensus sequencing (CCS)
approach.

Here, we characterize the Sequel System for the detection of
low-frequency somatic variants using constructs containing mutations in
coding regions in EGFR, NPM1, AKT1 and JAK2 representing deletion,
insertion, substitution and homopolymer variants. Wild type and mutant
amplicons, provided by SeraCare, were mixed and serially diluted from 10%
down to 0.1% allelic frequency. Independent SMRTbell libraries were
constructed for each dilution point, sequenced and analyzed using SMRT
Sequencing to identify the variants and determine the observed frequency.
The random error profile and high-accuracy CCS reads make it possible to
accurately detect low-frequency somatic variants. We will demonstrate
sensitivity of the PacBio Systems to detect mutations down to 0.1%.
