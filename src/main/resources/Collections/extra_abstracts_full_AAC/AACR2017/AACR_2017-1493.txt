Title: LonP1 is required for tumor maintenance and growth.


Proper mitochondrial function is critical for energy production and the
cycling of metabolites required for tumor establishment and growth. LonP1
is an ATP-dependent serine protease that is critical for maintaining
mitochondrial protein homeostasis by degrading misfolded and damaged
proteins in the mitochondrial matrix. Knockdown of LonP1 has been shown
to reduce tumorogenesis and is consistent with the model that requires
properly functioning mitochondria for tumor establishment. It is unclear
what the role of LonP1 is in tumor maintenance and growth from an
established tumor, therefore the LonP1 gene was mutated and complemented
by a doxycycline-inducible copy of LonP1. These complementation clones
have the ability to establish tumors in vivo in the presence of
doxycycline, however upon doxycycline withdrawal the tumors regress and
show evidence of apoptosis. These xenograft lines permit unique insight
into not only potential LonP1 substrates but also the direct and indirect
effects from loss of mitochondrial matrix protein homeostasis. Comparison
and contrast of these complemented cell lines in vitro and in vivo by
expression and proteomic analysis will be discussed.
