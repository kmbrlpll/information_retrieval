Title: The maximum tumor length and lymph node metastasis in esophageal
squamous cell carcinomas.


The lymph node metastasis (LNM) is one of the crucial risk factors for
esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) prognosis. However, it is
difficult to precisely determine the LNM status before surgery. The
maximum tumor length (MTL) may reflect the ESCC growth speed and could be
calculated accurately either with computed tomography or ultrasound
endoscopy before esophagectomy. Therefore the present study was designed
to determine if the MTL could reflect the LNM status for ESCC. A total of
22,660 ESCC patients was enrolled in this study from the ESCC database
(1973-2015) in Henan Key Laboratory for Esophageal Cancer Research of the
First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University. Of these patients, there
were 13,793 males with an mean age of 60±8, and 8,867 females with an
mean age of 61±8. All the cases had been performed radical
esophagectomy. The MTL and LNM records were retrieved from the medical
records in hospitals. Based on the 6th version of UICC criteria, the LNM
was classified as N0 and N1. The MTL was classified as 5 groups: The
