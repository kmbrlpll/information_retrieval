Title: Thymoquinone Inhibits Proliferation and induces apoptosis in
leukemic cells.


Introduction: Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is caused by human T‐cell
lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV‐1) and is an aggressive form of malignancy.
So far, there is no effective treatment for ATL. Thymoquinone has been
reported to exhibit many useful effects including anti-cancerous
properties. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigated the
effects of TQ on proliferation, apoptosis induction and the underlying
mechanism of action in both HTLV-1 positive (C91-PL and HuT-102) and
HTLV-1 negative (CEM and Jurkat) malignant T-lymphocytes. Materials and
methods: Cells were treated with various concentrations of thymoquinone
for 24h. Cell cytotoxicity was assayed using the CytoTox 96®
Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay Kit. Cell proliferation was determined
using CellTiter 96® Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation. Cell cycle
analysis was performed using staining with propidium iodide. Apoptosis
was assessed using cell death ELISA kit. The effect of TQ on p53, p21,
Bcl-2 protein expression was determined using Western blot analysis while
TGF mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR. Results: At non-cytotoxic
concentrations of TQ, it resulted in inhibition of proliferation in a
dose dependant manner. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a shift in the
cell cycle distribution to the PreG1 phase which is a marker of
apoptosis. Also TQ increased DNA fragmentation. TQ mediated its
anti-proliferative effect and apoptosis induction by an up-regulation of
TGFβ1, p53 and p21 and a down-regulation of TGF-α and Bcl-2α.
Conclusion: Thymoquinone showed antiproliferative and proapoptotic
potentials in ATL cells. For this reason, further research is required to
investigate its possible application in the treatment of ATL.
