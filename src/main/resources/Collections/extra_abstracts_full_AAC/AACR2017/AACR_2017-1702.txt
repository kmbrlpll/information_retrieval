Title: Multimeric anti-DR5 IgM antibody displays potent cytotoxicity in
vitro and promotes tumor regression in vivo.


Death receptor 5 (DR5) is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily that
induces apoptosis upon receptor trimerization. It is expressed on many
tumor types and has therefore been an important target for developing
antibody based treatments of epithelial, solid tumors. However several
agonistic Anti-DR5 IgG antibodies that have demonstrated efficacy in
preclinical models have been unsuccessful in clinical trials, likely due
to insufficient receptor crosslinking by bivalent IgGs. We have developed
a multimeric anti-DR5 IgM antibody which has strong avidity for the
receptor. The IgM binds Colo205 cells and triggers apoptosis, and is
1000-fold more potent than the respective IgG and 100-fold more potent
than crosslinked IgG in vitro. Anti-DR5 IgM displays strong in vitro
potency across a panel of tumor cell lines, including ones that are
IgG-resistant. Anti-DR5 IgM causes tumor regression and delays tumor
growth in various in vivo xenograft models including Colo205, HCT15 and
MDA-MB231. These results support the development of an human anti-DR5 IgM
therapeutic with the potential to treat solid tumors.
