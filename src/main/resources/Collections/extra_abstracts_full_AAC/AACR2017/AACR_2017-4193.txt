Title: A triple exon-skipping luciferase reporter assay identifies a new
CLK inhibitor scaffold.


The splicing of pre-mRNA is a critical process in normal cells and is
deregulated in cancer. Compounds that modulate this process have recently
been shown to target a specific vulnerability in tumors. We have
developed a novel cell-based assay that specifically activates luciferase
in cells exposed to SF3B1 targeted compounds, such as sudemycin D6. This
assay was used to screen a combined collection of approved drugs and
bioactive compounds. This screening approach identified several active
hits, the most potent of which were CGP-74514A and aminopurvalanol A,
both have been reported to be cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) inhibitors.
We found that these compounds, and their analogs, show significant
cdc2-like kinase (CLK) inhibition and clear structure-activity
relationships (SAR) at CLKs. We prepared a set of analogs and were able
to ‘dial out’ the CDK activity and simultaneously developed CLK
inhibitors with low nanomolar activity. Thus, we have demonstrated the
utility of our exon-skipping assay and identified new molecules that
exhibit potency and selectivity for CLK, as well as some structurally
related dual CLK/CDK inhibitors.
