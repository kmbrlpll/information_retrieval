Title: Testing the combined effects of low dose olaparib plus ibrutinib
on MCL cytotoxicity.


Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) presents a therapeutic challenge, with
frequent relapses after therapy due to high levels of DNA damage and
disease evolution. One currently approved MCL therapeutic, ibrutinib, is
a tissue-specific agent with relatively few adverse effects. However,
ibrutinib is administered at high dose for MCL and provides only a short
progression-free survival time. To potentially improve ibrutinib therapy
for MCL, we tested the effects of combining ibrutinib with the DNA damage
response inhibitor, olaparib, on MCL cells in vitro. We confirmed that
ibrutinib monotherapy is cytotoxic to MCL cell lines only at high doses
(> 25 μM). In contrast, single-agent olaparib treatment is cytotoxic at
lower concentrations (10 μM). Importantly, the addition of low dose
olaparib to ibrutinib has an additive cytotoxic effect. Notably, the
effects of ibrutinib alone and in combination are dependent on cell
medium composition. Our findings support clinical testing of ibrutinib
plus olaparib therapy to reduce MCL cell burden initially and to
potentially slow MCL cell evolution in the longer term. Our data also
suggest the possibility for more effective ibrutinib-based therapy via
manipulation of the MCL cell niche.
