Title: BCCIPβ modulates the ribosomal and extraribosomal function of S7
through a direct interaction.


Extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins (RPs) have gained much
attention for their implications in tumorigenesis and progression.
However, the regulations of transition between the ribosomal and
extraribosomal functions of RPs are rarely reported. Herein, we
identified a novel ribosomal protein S7-interacting partner, BCCIPβ,
which could modulate the functional conversion of S7. Through the
N-terminal acidic domain, BCCIPβ interacted with the central basic
region in S7 and regulated the extraribosomal distribution of S7. BCCIPβ
deficiency abrogated the ribosomal accumulation but enhanced the
ribosomal-free location of S7. This translocation further impaired
protein synthesis and triggered ribosomal stress. Consequently, BCCIPβ
deficiency suppressed the ribosomal function and launched the
extraribosomal function of S7, and eventually resulted in cell
proliferation restriction. In conclusion, BCCIPβ, as a novel S7
modulator, contributes to the delicate regulation of ribosomal and
extraribosomal functions of S7 and has implications in cell growth and
tumor development.
