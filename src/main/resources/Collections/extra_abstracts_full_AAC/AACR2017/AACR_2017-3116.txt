Title: Dysregulated cholesterol synthesis is a therapeutic vulnerability
in glioblastoma.


A hallmark of cellular transformation is the evasion of contact-dependent
inhibition of growth. To find new therapeutic targets for glioblastoma,
we looked for pathways that are inhibited by high cell density in normal
astrocytes but have lost this regulation in glioma cells. Here we report
that at high cell density, normal astrocytes turn off cholesterol
synthesis but glioma cells keep this pathway on. Correspondingly,
cholesterol pathway upregulation is associated with poor prognosis in
glioblastoma patients. Densely-plated glioma cells increase oxygen
consumption to synthesize cholesterol, resulting in a decrease in
reactive oxygen species, TCA cycle intermediates, and ATP, but without a
compensating increase in aerobic glycolysis. This constitutive
cholesterol synthesis is controlled by the cell cycle, as it can be
turned off by cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors and it correlates with
disabled cell cycle control though loss of p53 and RB. Finally, glioma
cells, but not astrocytes, are sensitive to cholesterol synthesis
inhibition downstream of the mevalonate pathway, suggesting that
specifically targeting cholesterol synthesis might be an effective
treatment for glioblastoma.
