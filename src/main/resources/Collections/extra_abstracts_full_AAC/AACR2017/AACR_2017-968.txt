Title: Podoplanin's diverse potential as a chemotherapeutic target for
oral squamous cell carcinom.


Oral cancer is diagnosed in over 300 thousand people, and kills over 100
thousand people, around the world each year. Current treatments rely on
radiation and surgery procedures that often decrease the quality of life
for oral cancer survivors. There is a clear need to improve treatments
for these patients. Over 90% of oral cancers are oral squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC). Most OSCC cells express the transmembrane receptor
podoplanin (PDPN), which has emerged as a promising target for OSCC
treatment. The PDPN receptor promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis
which leads to the vast majority of cancer deaths. Here, we describe
efforts to target PDPN in order to prevent and treat oral cancer. PDPN
can be targeted with Maackia amurensis seed lectin (MASL) to inhibit
tumor cell migration and viability. Recent evidence also suggests that
PDPN may undergo cancer specific changes, which indicates another
potential route for targeting PDPN in oral cancer. Taken together, these
data indicate that PDPN can serve as a functionally relevant target to
prevent and combat oral cancer.
