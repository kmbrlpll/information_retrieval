Title: Regulation mechanism and clinical significance of KPNA2 promotes
MDSCs infiltrating in epithelial ovarian cancer.


Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) are a population of immune cells
that negatively regulate immune responses, which could promote tumor
invasion and metastasis. Recently research has revealed that tumor could
actively reshape the immune-microenvironment for its progression. We
recently demonstrated that KPNA2 is a candidate oncogene in ovarian
cancer that was closely related to MDSCs density, and found there was a
positive position feedback between KPNA2 expressed and MDSCs density,
which might contribute to the poor prognosis of patients. Based on these
results, we combined clinical sample analysis, animal model and
experimental studies to do further molecular and genomic research. The
conduction of this project will help explain the molecular mechanisms of
how KPNA2 regulates ovarian cancer through suppressing the immune system,
and provide new strategies by molecular targeted therapy combining
biological therapy for ovarian cancer.
