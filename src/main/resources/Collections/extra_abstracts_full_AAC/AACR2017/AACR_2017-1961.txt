Title: Downregulation of proteasome activity promotes
epithelial-mesenchymal transition.


The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental program
that is aberrantly activated in cancer cells, producing an invasive
phenotype that can lead to metastases. Inducers of EMT are largely known
and have been widely studied. However, the mechanisms that regulate the
link between extracellular stimuli and EMT phenotypes remain poorly
understood. Preliminary evidence from our laboratory suggests that
downregulation of proteasome activity may be responsible, in part, for
driving EMT. Using immortalized human mammary epithelial (HMLE) cells as
a model, we show that (1) EMT is associated with decreased proteasome
activity and increased polyubiquitinated substrates, (2) pharmacologic
inhibition of proteasome activity leads to increased EMT phenotypes and
functionality, and (3) pharmacologic inhibition of proteasome activity
leads to increased EMT via stabilization of the TGF-Î² signaling pathway.
Together, these data suggest that proteasome activity may be an
unappreciated regulator of EMT.
