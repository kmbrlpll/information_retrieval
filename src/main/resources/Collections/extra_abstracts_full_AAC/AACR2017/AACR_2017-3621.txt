Title: Characterization of the effects of estrogen receptor alpha Y537S
and D538G mutations on receptor pharmacology.


The frontline therapy for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) positive Breast
Cancer (ER+BC) involves various forms of endocrine therapy, consisting of
either Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) or aromatase
inhibitors. An emerging mechanism of ER+BC resistance to endocrine
therapy, and consequently disease relapse, has been associated with a set
of “hotspot” mutations in and near to helix-12 of the ERα ligand
binding domain. Selective Estrogen Receptor Degraders/Down-regulators
(SERDs) represent an important pharmacological strategy being applied to
develop treatments for resistant ER+BC. Here, we compare 2 of the most
frequent ERα hotspot mutations (Y537S and D538G), with ERα wildtype
(WT) and the ability of a set of SERM/SERDs and other ERα ligands to
bind, antagonize, degrade/stabilize ERα and affect cell proliferation.
Common themes that emerged included the observation that the
concentration of each drug required to bind, antagonize or degrade ERα
Y537S or ERα D538G was typically higher than that required for ERα WT,
although the extent of the shift varied between drugs and the type of
measurement. An unexpected observation was that 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (a
major active metabolite of tamoxifen) stabilized nuclear ERα Y537S
protein. This represents a potential mechanism that may limit the
efficacy of Tamoxifen in treating ERα Y537S ER+BC.
