Title: The cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B is a regulator of gene expression
in breast cancer.


The APOBEC3B (A3B) cytidine deaminase gene has been implicated driving
the mutational landscape in breast and other cancer types. We have
discovered that A3B is a co-activator of estrogen receptor (ER) mediated
gene expression in breast cancer. Mechanistic studies established that
A3B regulates gene expression by promoting C-to-U deamination at ER
binding regions. We show that these C-to-U changes lead to the generation
of DNA strand breaks through activation of base excision repair (BER) and
to repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways. We have
performed RNA-seq and A3B ChIP-seq, in multiple ER+ and ER- breast cancer
cell lines. Remarkably, these studies demonstrate that A3B regulates the
expression of many genes in inflammatory and interferon signaling
pathways, in addition to the regulation of ER target genes. These
findings, together with other data to be presented, provide a clear role
for A3B in transcription regulation. These findings also raise the
possibility that transcription factor mediated recruitment of A3B to DNA
may facilitate acquisition of A3B driven cancer mutations.
