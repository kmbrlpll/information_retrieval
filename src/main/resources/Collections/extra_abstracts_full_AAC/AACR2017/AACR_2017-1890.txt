Title: PLEK2 contributes to lung cancer progression through upregulation
of NDRG1 expression.


PLEK2 is one of the pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain) proteins.
Recently studies suggested that PLEK2 may play a critical role in T
lymphocyte migration through by PI3K/AKT dependent and independent
pathways. However, the biological functions of PLEK2 in lung cancer is
not clear. We detected the expression of PLEK2 in various lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines using quantitative RT-PCR methods. The results
indicated that PLEK2 expression significantly positive correction with
cancer cell migration and invasion ability. Forced expression of PLEK2 in
lung cancer cells exhibited markedly promoting in the proliferation rate,
anchorage independent growth, cell motility and invasion, whereas
knockdown of PLEK2 was found to suppress lung cancer cell progression. In
addition, we also reported that PLEK2 expression induce lung cancer cell
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenomenon, and involve in
chemotherapeutic drug resistance through upregulation NDRG1 gene
expression. Overexpression of NDRG1 in PLEK2-knockdown cell line restored
cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These results will
provide information and help us to understand the roles of NDRG1 in lung
cancer cells.
