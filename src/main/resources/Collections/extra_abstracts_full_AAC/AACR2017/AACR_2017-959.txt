Title: Targeting neuronal activity regulated neuroligin-3 dependency for
high-grade glioma therapy.


Neuronal activity promotes high-grade glioma (HGG) growth. An important
mechanism mediating this neural regulation of brain cancer is
activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic molecule and
glioma mitogen neuroligin-3 (Nlgn3), but the therapeutic potential of
targeting Nlgn3 in glioma remains to be defined. Here, we demonstrate a
striking dependence of HGG growth on microenvironmental Nlgn3 and
determine a targetable mechanism of secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic
xenografts of pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) and diffuse intrinsic pontine
glioma (DIPG) fail to grow in Nlgn3 knock out mice. Using genetic mouse
models, we illustrate that Nlgn3 is cleaved from both neurons and
oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the ADAM10 sheddase. Administration
of an ADAM10 inhibitor robustly blocks pGBM and DIPG xenograft growth via
modulation of the tumor microenvironment. This work defines the
therapeutic potential of and an effective strategy for targeting Nlgn3
secretion in the glioma microenvironment, which could prove
transformative for treatment of HGG.
