Title: Characterization of URST1 as a prognostic biomarker and
therapeutic target for lung cancer.


Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer deaths worldwide and its
overall prognosis remains poor. Therefore, next generation of biomarkers
and therapeutic strategies for lung cancer are eagerly awaited. We
selected genes that were overexpressed in the majority of lung cancer
using our gene expression profile database. During this process, we
identified URST1 (Up-regulated in solid tumor 1) as a candidate.
Immunohistochemical staining showed that URST1 expression was observed in
the majority of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (P = 0.0013
by log rank test). Multivariate analysis revealed high level of URST1
expression was an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC patients.
Moreover, reduction of URST1 by siRNA or treatment with URST1 inhibitor
significantly suppressed lung cancer cell growth probably through cell
cycle arrest at G2/M. Exposure of cancer cells to URST1 inhibitor
significantly suppressed These data suggest that URST1 is a possible
prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancer.
