Title: Enhanced YAP expression leads to EGFR TKI resistance in lung
adenocarcinomas.


Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is prevalently expressed
in lung adenocarcinoma cases and acts as one of the major driving
oncogenes. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been used in
patients with EGFR-mutant as an effective targeted therapy in lung
adenocarcinoma, but drug resistance and tumor recurrence inevitably
occurs. Recently, Yes-associate protein (YAP) has been reported to
promote multiple cancer cell properties, such as promoting cell
proliferation, EMT and drug resistance. This study investigated the roles
of YAP in TKI-resistant lung adenocarcinoma. In TKI-sensitive cells,
enhanced YAP expression leads to TKI resistant. Also, upregulated YAP
expression and activation were detected in long term TKI-induced
resistant cells. With reduced YAP expression using shRNA or YAP
inhibitors, TKI-resistant cells become TKI-sensitive. Moreover, combined
EGFR TKI and an YAP inhibitor statin, prolonged survival among lung
cancer patients analyzed by Taiwan National Health Insurance Research
database. These observations revealed the importance of YAP in promoting
TKI-resistance and combined YAP inhibition can be a potential therapy
delaying the occurrence of TKI-resistance in lung adenocarcinoma.
