Title: USP7 inhibitors impair Foxp3+ T regulatory cell function and
promote antitumor immunity against solid tumors.


Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays critical role in suppressing the
immune system’s ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells. Although
T cell checkpoint blockers such as anti-PD1 antibodies unleash anti-tumor
immune response against a variety of tumors, the complex
immunosuppressive tumor milieu necessitates development of additional
therapeutic agents to potentiate active drugs and expand the realm of the
revolutionary cancer immunotherapy. The presence of highly
immunosuppressive Foxp3+ T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in the TME has been
correlated with poor prognosis. Thus, depletion of Tregs or impairment of
Treg function is considered an attractive therapeutic approach. USP7, a
deubiquitylase (DUB) implicated as a critical node in several cancer
signaling pathways has emerged as an essential factor in maintaining Treg
functions. Treg specific deletion of USP7 impairs Treg function leading
to lethal autoimmunity. Using the UbiProTM discovery platform, Progenra
has identified selective covalent USP7 inhibitors that were subjected to
lead optimization and preclinical evaluation. Potent and selective
candidate USP7 inhibitors have been shown to impair Treg functions ex
vivo and in vivo as well as exhibit powerful anti-tumor activity against
syngeneic lung tumor models in immunocompetent mice. Most importantly,
Progenra’s USP7 inhibitors enhances the efficacy of anti-PD1 antibody
and cancer vaccines. Along with the already established direct anti-tumor
activities of USP7 inhibitors, these studies provide a strong rationale
for combining USP7 inhibitors to suppress Treg functions and improve the
efficacy of currently approved cancer immunotherapy agents.
