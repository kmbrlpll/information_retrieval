Title: Increased expression of ABCB1 could be associated with osimertinib
resistance in non-small cell lung cancer cell line PC9 cell.


Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown
promising activity in EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) which harboring T790M mutation. The mechanisms of resistance to
osimertinib have been still unclear. To investigate the mechanisms of
acquired resistance to osimertinib, we established the
osimertinib-resistant cell line (PC9/osimertinib) from the NSCLC cell
lines PC9, and measured the expression levels of ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters using quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction. Expression profiling of ABC transporters revealed that the
levels of ABCB1 gene expression were significantly increased in the
PC9/osimertinib cells compared with the parental cells, but not other ABC
transporters. Knockdown of ABCB1 expression using short hairpin RNA
enhanced osimertinib cytotoxicity in PC9/osimertinib cells. These data
suggest that increased expression of ABCB1 may have an important role in
the acquired resistance to osimertinib.
