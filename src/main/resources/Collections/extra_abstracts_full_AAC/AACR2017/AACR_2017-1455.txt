Title: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms among Sudanese females
with breast cancer attending Radio and Isotope Center of Khartoum.


Background: Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms has been reported
to

be associated with different cancers, including breast cancer.
geographical and

environmental factors have an impact on vitamin D (VD) metabolism. This
study

aims to evaluate VDR-gene polymorphisms (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1, Apa1) and its

association with breast cancer risk among Sudanese females.

Materials and Methods: this is a case control study done in the Radio and
Isotope

Center in Khartoum, Sudan. Hundred thirty seven patients and 69 healthy
controls

were enrolled after informed consent. Blood genomic DNA was extracted
using

quinidine chloroform method, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
Fok1

(T/C) [rs2228570], Bsm1 (G/A) [rs1544410], Taq1 (C/T) [rs731236] and Apa1
(C/A)

[(rs7975232] in VDR-gene were detected by PCR and restriction fragment
length

polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis.

Results: VDR-SNPs rs731236 correlated significantly with low risk of
breast cancer

(OR=0.5, p= 0.002). There was no significant association observed with
rs1544410

and rs7975232. Although our study did not show an overall statistically
significant

association of VDR-SNPs rs2228570 with the risk of breast cancer, we
found a 1.3

fold increased risk of breast cancer (OR= 1.3) among females with FF
genotype when

compared with ff genotype, suggesting that females homozygous for F
allele, might be

at more risk than females carrying homozygous f allele.

Conclusions: These results suggested that, VDR-SNPs rs2228570 may be
related to

higher risk of breast cancer and VDR-SNPs rs731236 associated with lower
risk of

breast cancer in Sudanese females.
