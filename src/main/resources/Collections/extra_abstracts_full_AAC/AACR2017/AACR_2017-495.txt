Title: Somatic copy number variants detection using the NEBNext Direct
target enrichment method.


Variations in copy number are the most common type of DNA structural
variations. Many of these alterations are associated with disease or
indicate disease susceptibility. Detection of copy number variants (CNVs)
for clinical applications requires efficient, fast and cost effective
methods.

Here we describe the use of the NEBNext DirectÂ® hybridization-based
target enrichment method to identify somatic CNVs with high sensitivity.
This approach begins with target enrichment followed by enzymatic
digestion of off-target sequences and ligation of adapters that contain
unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). The UMIs enhance the identification
of duplicate reads and further increase the final number of on-target
reads used for variant detection.

We used a cell line known to contain a deletion in the CDKN2A gene and
spiked DNA isolated from the cell line into a HapMap DNA sample that
contains full diploid copies of CDKN2A. We were able to detect the gene
deletion as a somatic CNV in a dose dependent manner with high
sensitivity. Thus, we demonstrate that the NEBNext Direct approach is an
efficient technique to detect somatic CNVs of high and low frequencies.
