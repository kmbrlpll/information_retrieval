Title: Differential expression of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) between
benign and malignant tissues among human organs.


Background: Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), a lysosomal enzyme is able to
degrade cholesteryl esters to free fatty acids and cholesterol. The
information on the association of LAL with malignancies is limited. This
study is to determine the difference in expression level of LAL between
benign and malignant tissues among human organs.

Method: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for human LAL was performed on A
tissue microarray (TMA) containing 360 benign and malignant tissues from
36 human organs. The expression level of LAL was represented by an IHC
score calculated by multiplying area score (0-3) with intensity score
(0-3), ranged from 0 to 9. Studentâ€™s t-test was used to compare the
mean IHC score between benign and malignant tissues in same organs.

Results: Eighteen out of 36 human organs have IHC stains on both benign
and malignant tissues. As shown in Table 1, LAL expression level was
higher in malignancy than in benign tissues in 9 organs. The difference
in LAL expression level was significantly (or nearly lower in malignant
tissues of adrenal gland, stomach, liver, testis and kidney.

Conclusion: The expression level of LAL varies among human organs. As
compared with elevation of LAL expression level, decreased expression
level of LAL in malignancies could be of more significance.
