Title: HnRNP Q1 translationally increases the expression of Aurora-A and
promotes tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer.


Abnormally elevated Aurora-A can cause mitotic defects and aneuploidy,
which might lead to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. According to
the literatures, overexpressed Aurora-A may result from gene
amplification, RNA transcriptional activation, or increased protein
stability. Our previous study has demonstrated that Aurora-A can be
translational upregulated in colorectal cancer. By biotin pull-down assay
and in vivo translational assay, we found that Aurora-A mRNA can be
translational upregulated by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein
(hnRNP) Q1, a RNA binding protein. Hn RNP Q1 has been implicated in many
posttranscriptional regulatory processes including mRNA splicing, RNA
metabolism and translation. In this study, we further clarified the
regulatory mechanism of hnRNP Q1 in translational regulating Aurora-A
mRNA, as well as investigated the clinical role of hnRNP Q1 in colorectal
carcinogenesis. Our results indicated that hnRNP Q1 can bind to the
Aurora-A mRNA 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR). Ribosomal protein
S6-IP assay further indicated that hnRNP Q1 can enhance the translational
efficacy of Aurora-A mRNA. Ribosomal profiling assay further confirmed
the translational regulation of Aurora-A mRNA by hnRNP Q1. Overexpression
of hnRNP Q1 promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth. The expression
level of hnRNP Q1 is positively correlated with Aurora-A in colorectal
cancer. Taken together, our data indicate hnRNP Q1 is a novel
trans-acting factor that binds to Aurora-A mRNA 5’-UTRs and regulates
its translation, which increases cell proliferation and contributes to
tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer.
