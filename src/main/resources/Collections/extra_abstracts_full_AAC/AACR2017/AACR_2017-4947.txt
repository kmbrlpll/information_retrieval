Title: Her2 inhibition and dormant cell metabolism.


Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women in the United States,
and despite improved prognosis resulting from targeted therapies, tumors
commonly re-emerge upon development of therapeutic resistance. In order
to overcome this, it is critical to explore the cellular pathways that
change in tumors following treatment. While many mechanisms of resistance
to targeted therapies have been identified, the metabolic changes that
occur following treatment have not been well defined. We believe that
these changes may offer a general therapeutic target. Using a
doxycycline-inducible Her2 mouse model of breast cancer, we are exploring
the molecular and cellular consequences Her2 inhibition. Using in vitro
mammosphere cultures derived from these mice, we showed that Her2 loss
quickly downregulates ERK and Akt signaling. There is a corresponding
decrease in proliferation, and apoptosis is induced in 25-50% of cells.
However, a population of cells survives Her2 withdrawal and remains
dormant for upwards of one month. We are using these models to study how
metabolic pathways are rewired following Her2 inhibition, and we believe
that the metabolic pathways adapted upon Her2 inhibition may represent
targetable vulnerabilities.
