Title: Identification and optimization of a highly active, cross reactive
Complex-1 inhibitor.


Mitochondria are key regulators of both energy supply and apoptotic cell
death. The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) consists of four
enzyme complexes that transfer electrons from NADH to oxygen. During
electron transfer, the ETC pumps protons into the inter-membrane space,
generating a gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is
used by Complex V to drive ATP synthesis. Recent publications have shown
that tumor cells harboring specific mutations (LKB1, mIDH and others) are
more sensitive to Complex I inhibition, potentially providing an
opportunity for selectively targeting tumor cells.

Based on a high throughput screen (HTS), we identified new, albeit
moderately active, lead structures with cross reactivity between mouse
and human Complex 1. SAR elaboration of the lead structure allowed for
optimization of the potency, although compounds still suffered from low
metabolic stability. Further improvement of the in vitro and in vivo PK
properties finally permitted in vivo animal studies. Herein, we report
for the first time the preclinical profile and structure of a highly
active, optimized, human/mouse cross-reactive Complex I inhibitor that
allowed for the further investigation into the therapeutic potential of
Complex I inhibition in cancer.
