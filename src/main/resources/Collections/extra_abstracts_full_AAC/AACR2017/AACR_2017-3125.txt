Title: Therapeutic implications of mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitors in
genetically heterogeneous glioblastoma.


Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, which
is characterized by marked intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK) genes. Aberrations in the RTK/PI3K/Akt pathways in
GB leads to an abnormal signaling pathway of mechanistic target of
Rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR exists in two distinct complexes, namely, mTORC1
and mTORC2, which are involved in regulation of cell survival, growth,
and motility. In this investigation, we test the hypothesis that the
genetic heterogeneity of GBM cells and its stem cells with respect to the
expression of EGFR and/or PDGFRα may define the treatment efficacy of
RTK inhibitors with or without PI3K/ mTOR inhibitors. We demonstrated
that GB tumors over-expressed PDGFRα and EGFR at range of 80% and 30%,
respectively, with varying degree of overlap. Combined treatment with the
inhibitors of PDGFRα (AC 710) or EGFR (gefitinib), with or without
inhibitors of mTORC1 (rapamycin) or mTORC1/2 (Torin1 and Torin 2), led to
suppression of cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell migration and drug
resistance in GB cells to varying degrees that correlated with EGFR or
PDGFRα expression. Downstream signaling pathway substrates of mTORC 1
and 2, namely pS6k and pAkt, respectively, were suppressed by combined
treatments of RTK and mTORC1/2 inhibitors. Furthermore, GB stem cell
self-renewal and growth was also suppressed with combined treatments. The
combination of AC710 plus mTORC1/2 inhibitor, Torin2, was the most
effective. These findings underscore the usefulness of determining
PDGFRα and EGFR status when considering viable PI3K/mTOR inhibitors for
targeted treatment of GB.
