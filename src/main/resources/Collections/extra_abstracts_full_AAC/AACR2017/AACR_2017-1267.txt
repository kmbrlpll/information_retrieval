Title: Emodin exerts its anticancer effect on colon cancer cells by
inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis.


Despite state of the art diagnostic and therapeutic options offered in
the clinics, colon cancer is still a major health care concern.
Therapeutic outcome is often compromised due to late diagnosis and
development of resistance against treatment options used to treat
advanced disease. Hence, the need to explore new avenue to treat/prevent
colon cancer more effectively still exist. In this study we have
investigated potential impact of Emodin, an anthraquinone derived from
plant (Rheum rhabarbarum) on colon cancer cell proliferation, survival
and apoptosis. Our data show that emodin reduces the cell viability and
inhibits proliferation of human colon cancer cell (COLO-201 and DLD-1) in
a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, FACS analysis show higher
percentage of apoptotic cells with Emodin treatment compared to untreated
cells. Interestingly, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines
produced by colon cancer cells were modulated with Emodin treatment.
Cancer cells often use these cytokines to achieve their goal to progress
and escape the treatment. Our data implies Emodin could be a promising
agent that could be used for chemoprevention as well as in therapeutic
combination to improve efficacy of conventional therapy.
