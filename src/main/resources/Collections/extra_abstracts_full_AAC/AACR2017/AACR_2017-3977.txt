Title: Neutrophils fertilize the pre-metastatic omental niche in ovarian
cancer.


More than 60% of ovarian cancer patients present with peritoneal
carcinomatosis that almost always involves the omentum, a fat pad that
suspends from the stomach. However, the mechanisms that promote the
tropism of ovarian cancer cells for the omentum are poorly understood.
Because the omentum is the major peritoneal conduit and reservoir for
immune cells, we hypothesized that immune cells control the propensity of
ovarian cancer cells to implant on the omentum. In this study, we
evaluated changes in immune cell populations in the omentum and in other
visceral fat pads in the peritoneal cavity in mouse xenograft models of
ovarian cancer. Intriguingly, the proportion of neutrophils was observed
to dramatically increase in the omentum prior to tumor cell implantation
at this site. On the other hand, the proportion of neutrophils did not
substantially increase in other visceral fat pads. Furthermore, the
proportion of macrophages did not significantly increase in any of the
fat tissues prior to tumor cell implantation. Collectively, these
findings raise the possibility that early recruitment of neutrophils to
the pre-metastatic omental niche promotes a microenvironment that is
conducive to ovarian cancer cell implantation at this site.
