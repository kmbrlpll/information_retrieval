Title: Design and synthesis of BPR1K653 and its derivatives targeting the
back pocket of Aurora kinases for selective isoform inhibition.


Guided by computational modeling addressing the back pocket of Aurora
kinases, several novel chemical analogs of BPR1K653 were designed and
synthesized in two steps with 30-66% yields. All synthesized compounds
were evaluated by Aurora-A and Aurora-B enzymatic kinase activity assays,
cellular phosphorylation inhibition assays and cell viability assays. Of
them, compound 3a that exhibits no substitution at phenylurea showed
similar inhibition activity to Aurora-A and -B. Compounds 3b and 3c which
harbor tertiary amino group at meta position of phenylurea showed 10-15
fold inhibition selectivity for Aurora-A over Aurora-B in enzymatic
assays. In addition, 3b and 3c were more than 200 fold superior in
inhibiting T-loop autophosphorylation of Aurora-A compared to Aurora-B in
HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. On the other hand, compound 3d with a
4-hydroxypiperidinyl group at ortho position preserves Aurora-B
inhibition activity. Molecular docking study revealed that the various
steric interaction between the compound and residues in the back pocket
of Aurora kinases determines their inhibition selectivity.
