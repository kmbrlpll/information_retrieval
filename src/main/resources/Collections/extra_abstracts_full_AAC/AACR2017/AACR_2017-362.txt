Title: Repression of Smad3 by Stat3 and c-Ski/SnoN induces gefitinib
resistance in lung adenocarcinoma.


Cancer-associated inflammation develops resistance to the epidermal
growth-factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in
non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring oncogenic EGFR mutations.
Stat3-mediated Interleukin (IL)-6 signaling and Smad-mediated
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling play crucial regulatory
roles in cancer-associated inflammation. Here we show that Stat3
represses Smad3 in cooperation with c-Ski and SnoN, whereby renders
gefitinib-sensitive HCC827 cells resistant. IL-6 signaling via
phosphorylated Stat3 induced gefitinib resistance. By contrast, TGF-β
upregulated gefitinib sensitivity. We found that IL-6 signaling via
phosphorylated Stat3 repressed, whereas TGF-β upregulated the expression
of Smad3 in HCC827 cells. Promoter analyses showed that Stat3 synergized
with c-Ski/SnoN to repress Smad-induced transcription of the Smad3 gene.
Smad3 induced apoptosis by upregulating pro-apoptotic genes such as
Caspase 3 and downregulating anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl2. Our
results suggest that preventing IL-6/Stat3-induced loss of Smad3 can be a
therapeutic strategy to prevent gefitinib resistance in NSCLCs with
gefitinib-sensitive EGFR mutation.
