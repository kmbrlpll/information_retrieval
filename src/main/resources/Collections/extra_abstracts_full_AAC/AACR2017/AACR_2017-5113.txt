Title: Usnic acid, lichen secondary metabolite, inhibits glioblastoma
progression through the reduction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
and glioma stemness factors.


Background: Usnic acid (UA), an active compound mainly found in lichens,
has shown some anti-tumoral activities for lung and breast cancers. The
therapeutic role of UA in glioblastoma (GM) have not yet been determined,
nor has the definitive relationships of UA with EMT and cancer stem cells.

Methods: We tested the anti-tumoral activities of UA against glioblastoma
(GM) progression and further investigated the mechanistic link with
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness factors. The
targeting and anti-tumor effect of UA was also checked in orthotopic
mouse glioma model.

Results: In vitro assay, we found that UA increased apoptotic cell death
and inhibited the invasion/migration of GM cells. Sphere and colony
forming abilities were also decreased in treated GM cells. UA decreased
the expression of the EMT markers (N-cadherin, ZEB1, ZEB2, SNAIL and
SLUG) and the cancer stemness markers (CD133, ALDH1 and CD44). In
orthotopic mouse glioma models, UA localized in GBM and significantly
decreased tumor growth and progression to lead longer survival.

Conclusion: Taken together, these findings showed that UA prevent GBM
invasiveness and progression, through the down-regulation of EMT and
cancer stemness markers.
