Title: EBV associated gastric cancer in Korean.


Gastric cancer was the third leading cause of death worldwide and most
prevalent malignant cancer in Korea, comprising 20.8% of all cancers. The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) divided gastric cancer to four subgroups; EBV
(Epstein-Barr Virus infected, 9%), MSI (Microsatellite instability, 22%),
GS (Genomically stable, 20%), CIN (Chromosomal instability, 50%). We
sequenced transcriptomes of 11 gastric cancers associated with EBV
infection (EBVaGC) tissues, 11 gastric cancers not associated with EBV
infection (EBVnGC) tissues and 22 matched normal gastric mucosa for find
unique features of Korean EBVaGC. We compared RNA expression, EBV gene
expression, germline mutations, and somatic mutation between EBVaGC and
EBVnGC. We found IKBKE gene, which is taking an essential role in
regulating antiviral signaling pathways, expressed higher on EBVaGC tumor
than EBVnGC tumor (p-value=1.73 x 10-4). While most EBV genes appeared to
be similar, BMRF1,2 genes made distinctive patterns compared to previous
TCGA report in expression of EBV which integrated into human cells. The
BMRF-2 gene is associated with cell-to-cell spread of EBV, which is major
infection mechanism of EBV. We found novel germline mutations on PABPC3,
PGA3, and C4A,B in almost every samples, which are candidate for Korean
specific mutations.
