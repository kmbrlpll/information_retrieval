Title: UVB-induced ULBP1 upregulation in melanocytes depends on
HMGB1-mediated activation of NF-κB and IRF3.


Anti-tumor immune surveillance mediated by innate immunity cells such as
NK cells plays a critical role in eliminating “damaged” cells at
precancerous stage and preventing cancer progression. As a key
epidemiological factor associated with melanoma, solar UV radiation also
elicit immunosurveillance by upregulating ligands for NK cell activating
receptor NKG2D. Nevertheless, how UVR upregulates NKG2DL in melanocytes
is not completely understood. We found UVB exposure induced secretion of
damage-associated molecular patterns molecule HMGB1 from skin cells.
HMGB1 activates transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3 in melanocytes
which synergistically enhances NKG2D ligand ULBP1 transcription.
Moreover, RAGE is essential for HMGB1-induced activation of NF-κB and
IRF3, which serves as the HMGB1 receptor and mediates activation of TBK1.
Consistently, HMGB1 deficient melanoma cells are less susceptible to NK
cells mediated cytotoxicity. Our study provides a mechanistic link
between environmental UV radiation and antitumor immunosurveillance
induced in melanocytes, which may play a critical role in the early
stages of melanomagenesis.
