Title: Paired isolation and expansion of CSC and CTC from primary small
cell lung cancer patient tissue and blood using the 3DKUBE bioreactor
platform.


Surgical resection is rarely an option for small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
patients as the majority present with extensive disease at diagnosis.
This scarcity of patient samples suitable for research presents a
significant road block for the development of SCLC targeted-therapeutics.
To address the problem of tissue scarcity, we have developed a method for
the isolation and expansion of cancer stem cells (CSC) and circulating
tumor cells (CTC) from primary tissues and blood of SCLC patients using
the 3DKUBE™ perfusion microbioreactor. We have established a
label-free, combined chemical and functional selection method for the
isolation of CSCs from SCLC samples, solid tumor as well as blood, that
does not rely upon the bias imposed by marker-based selection. Cells
enriched in this manner were further purified and expanded under
optimized conditions (growth factors, ECM, scaffolding and oxygen
tension) within the 3DKUBE™ perfusion microbioreactor. These isolated
and expanded CSCs have maintained resistance to cisplatin and etoposide,
stabilized the expression of traditional CSC markers, and been validated
in vitro through serial spheroid formation assays. These CSCs are
currently being characterized and compared to parental tissue through
correlative genomic and phenomic analysis and validated through in vivo
tumorigenesis models. These cells will be utilized to generate 3D
microtumors to accurately predict SCLC drug response in vitro, a
determination that is not accurately performed in conventional 2D cell
culture and is inhibited by both cost and time in patient-derived
xenografts (PDX)
