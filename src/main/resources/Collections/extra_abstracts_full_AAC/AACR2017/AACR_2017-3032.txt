Title: Direct regulation of alternative splicing by Smad3 through PCBP1
is essential to the tumor-promoting role of transforming growth factor
beta1.


In advanced stages of cancers, TGF- β promotes tumor progression in
conjunction with inputs from receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. However,
the mechanisms that underpin the signaling cooperation and convert TGF-
β from a potent growth inhibitor to a tumor promoter are not fully
understood. In this work we report that TGF- β directly regulates
alternative splicing of cancer stem cell marker CD44 through a
phosphorylated T179 of SMAD3-mediated interaction with RNA-binding
protein PCBP1. We show that TGF- β and EGF respectively induce SMAD3 and
PCBP1 to colocalize in SC35 positive nuclear speckles, and the two
proteins interact in the variable exon region of CD44 pre-mRNA to inhibit
spliceosome assembly in favor of expressing the mesenchymal isoform CD44s
over the epithelial isoform CD44E. We further show that the
SMAD3-mediated alternative splicing is essential to the tumor-promoting
role of TGF- β and has a global influence on protein products of genes
instrumental to epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastasis.
