Title: Development of an antibody-drug conjugate with broad anticancer
activity.


Treatment for patients with advanced solid tumors that include triple
negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and
castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), as well as Mantle Cell
Lymphoma (MCL), while increasing survival is not curative. We have
identified a membrane bound protease, “activated” matriptase, as an
attractive target antigen for highly selective antibody delivery of
cytotoxins as activated matriptase expression is restricted to epithelial
tumors and some B-cell lymphomas. We generated a novel ADC by linking
M69, a mouse antibody specific to activated matriptase, to monomethyl
auristatin E (MMAE) via a PEGylated, releasable di-peptide linker as a
proof-of-principle prototype. Both in cell lines and in human xenograft
models of TNBC, NSCLC, CRPC and MCL, the conjugate was found to exhibit
potent anticancer activity against all of these tumor types without
toxicity. Encouraged by these results, we are also exploring the use of
this ADC against gastric and pancreatic cancer, and in combination with
chemotherapy and immunotherapy. As this is a mouse antibody, we are also
generating a chimeric antibody for toxicity studies in primates.
