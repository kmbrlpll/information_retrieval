Title: Macrophage conditioned medium promotes colon cancer stem cell
phenotype via the hedgehog signaling pathway.


Background: Contradicting studies have shown that increased macrophages
infiltration in colorectal cancer (CRC) could either result in
anti-tumoral or in pro-tumoral effects. Because of these inconsistencies,
we sought to determine the role of conditioned medium from macrophages,
in particular classically activated macrophages, on the development of
the CSC phenotype in CRC cells, which is believed to mediate tumor growth
and chemoresistance.

Methods: Murine (CT26) and human (HCP-1) CRC cell lines were treated with
conditioned media (CM) from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine
macrophages. Viability studies were performed using the MTT assay,
annexin V-FITC assay, and Western blot analysis. The CSC population was
assessed using the sphere-forming assay and aldehyde dehydrogenase assay.

Results: The results showed that 1) murine LPS-activated macrophage CM
induced apoptosis in murine and human CRC cells, 2) murine and human
LPS-activated macrophage CM secreted paracrine factors that promoted the
CSC phenotype in murine and human CRC cells via the Sonic hedgehog
(SHH)-Gli signaling pathway, which is known to drive self-renewal and 3)
these effects were blocked by depletion of SHH in macrophage CM.

Conclusions: Our data show that LPS-activated macrophages play an active
role in promoting the CSC phenotype through activation of the SHH-Gli
signaling pathway.
