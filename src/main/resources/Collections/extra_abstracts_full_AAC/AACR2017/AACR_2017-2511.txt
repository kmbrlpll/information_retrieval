Title: The role of lipids metabolism in bladder cancer.


Bladder cancer (BCa) is one of the most common malignancy of the urinary
tract. Many risk factors for BCa has been demonstrated, including aging,
smoking, exposure to chemicals, dietary total cholesterol intake, dietary
fatty acids intake, etc. In order to investigate the role of lipids
metabolism in bladder cancer, we collected several human BCa tissues and
normal bladder tissues to generate an affected pathway network by
microarray analysis, and it revealed that glycerolipid metabolism, fatty
acid degradation and fatty acid biosynthesis have a close correlation
with bladder cancer. Therefore, Simvastatin, one of the
3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors,
have been well-known regarding its effects on rate-limiting step in
cholesterol synthesis, was used to treat with BCa cells. We observed that
simvastatin could reduce BCa cell proliferation, induce cell cycle arrest
at G0/G1 phase and inhibit cell metastasis. Then, the potential
alterations of lipids metabolism in bladder cancer cells after
simvastatin treatment was investigate by lipidomics analysis. These
foundings demonstrate that lipids metabolism plays important role in
bladder cancer and some lipids or related enzymes may be the novel
targets for bladder cancer treatment.
