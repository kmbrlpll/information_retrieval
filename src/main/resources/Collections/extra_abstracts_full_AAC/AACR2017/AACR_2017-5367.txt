Title: Ngago: no evidence of targeted endonuclease activity.


The development of a versatile and easy to use genome editing tool based
on the bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system has led to a vast increase in
applications of genome editing in laboratories around the world. As an
extremely powerful and versatile tool it has facilitated important
discoveries in both basic and translational research as well as in a
potentially wide range of therapeutic applications. Natronobacterium
gregoryi Argonaute (NgAgo) protein was described as a favorable
alternative to Cas9 due to its simplicity and higher endonuclease
specificity. Thus far, there are no formal reports documenting the
success of NgAgo in other laboratory settings and cellular systems.
Utilizing the identical cellular background and protocol that was made
publicly available by the authors of the initial study, we were unable to
reproduce the endonuclease function of NgAgo. These results do not
support the role of NgAgo in gene editing experiments.
