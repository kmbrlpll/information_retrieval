Title: Autophagy is required for cell survival under
L-asparaginase-induced metabolic stress in acute lymphoblastic leukemia
cells.


L-asparaginase has been used for more than three decades in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and remains an essential drug in
the treatment of ALL. Poor response to L-asparaginase is associated with
increased risk of therapeutic failure in ALL. However, both the metabolic
perturbation and molecular context of L-asparaginase-treated ALL cells
has not been fully elucidated. Here we identify that treatment with
L-asparaginase results in metabolic shutdown via the reduction of both
glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, accompanied by mitochondrial
damage and activation of autophagy. The autophagy is involved in reducing
reactive oxygen species (ROS) level by eliminating injured mitochondria.
Inhibition of autophagy enhances L-asparaginase-induced cytotoxicity and
overcomes the acquired resistance to L-asparaginase in ALL cells. The
ROS-p53 positive feedback loop is an essential mechanism of this
synergistic cytotoxicity. Thus, our findings provide the rationale for
the future development of combined treatment of L-asparaginase and
anti-autophagy drug in ALL patients.
