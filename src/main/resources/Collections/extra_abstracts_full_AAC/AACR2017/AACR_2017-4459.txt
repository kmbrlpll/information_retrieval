Title: Glycine decarboxylase inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer
cells via SIRT1-mediated apoptosis.


Glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) is a very recently identified metabolic
oncogene that links glycine metabolism with tumorigenesis. We designed
this study to determine the mechanistic role of GLDC in in ovarian cancer
cells. First, we confirmed the expressions of GLDC in eight different
ovarian cancer cell lines. And colony formation assay revealed decreased
proliferation of OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells transfected with siGLDC
compared with that of control. Intriguingly, we found that knockdown of
GLDC induced decreased S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)/ S-adenosylhomocysteine
(SAH) ratio, which implicates methyl donor deficient state in OVCAR3
cells. Expressions of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), heat shock protein (HSP) 90 and
heat-shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) decreased while that of p53 increased
in GLDC knock-downed cells, suggesting heat shock response. Addition of
SAM into siGLDC knock-downed cell restored the expression of SIRT1.
Inhibition of SIRT1 decreased Bcl2 and increased cytochrome c
expressions. In summary, these results suggest GLDC induces methyl donor
deficient state in OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, which in turn leads to
apoptosis via SIRT1-mediated pathway.
