Title: PR55-alpha associated PP2A promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis.


PP2A holoenzyme consists of a catalytic subunit, a scaffold subunit, and
a regulatory subunit. Loss of function analysis using PP2A catalytic
inhibitors or inhibition via tumor viral proteins suggest PP2A as a
putative tumor suppressor. However, PP2A has also been shown to
facilitate the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways when associated
with specific regulatory subunits. In this study, we investigated the
possible oncogenic role of PP2A in pancreatic cancer. We found a striking
increase in the expression of PR55α, a PP2A regulatory subunit, in
pancreatic cancer cells compared to normal pancreatic epithelial cells.
Consistently, PR55α expression was markedly elevated in pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma tissues compared to adjacent normal pancreatic
tissues (PPP2A holoenzyme consists of a catalytic subunit, a scaffold

Consistently, PR55α expression was markedly elevated in pancreatic

patients (P<0.0003). RNAi-mediated depletion of PR55α in pancreatic
cancer cells resulted in diminished phosphorylation of both AKT and
ERK1/2 and decreased protein levels of β-catenin. Accordingly,
pancreatic cancer cells with reduced PR55α expression exhibited
significantly impaired properties of transformation, including attenuated
cell growth, clonogenicity, mobility, and anchorage-independent growth.
Moreover, orthotopic implantation of PR55α-depleted pancreatic cancer
cells into nude mice showed a marked reduction in tumorigenicity (PPP2A

(P<0.001) and distant metastases. These results suggest that PR55α
promotes pancreatic cancer development by sustaining hyperactivity of
multiple oncogenic signaling pathways, including AKT, ERK and Wnt.
