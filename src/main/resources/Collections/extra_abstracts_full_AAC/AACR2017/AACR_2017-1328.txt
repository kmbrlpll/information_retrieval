Title: Mechanism of transcriptional regulation of metabotropic glutamate
recepter-5 induced by the CXCR4 signaling pathway.


We have previously demonstrated that stromal cell-derived factor
(SDF)-1/CXCR4 system enhances the metastases of oral cancer cells via
induction of mGluR5. In this study, we examined the transcriptional
regulation of mGluR5 induced by the SDF-1/CXCR4 system, using oral cancer
cells, B88, which express functional CXCR4 and have highly metastatic
potentials. mGluR5 was markedly induced both by the exogenous SDF-1
addition and overexpression of SDF-1 in B88 cells. These induction was
completely inhibited by a MEK inhibitor, U0126, and partially inhibited
by a PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. Furthermore, these inhibitors
significantly inhibited the SDF-1/CXCR4 dependent cell-migration in the
presence or absence of mGluR5 agonist, DHPG. Recently, several
investigators demonstrated that activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is
responsible for the transcription of several cancer-associated microRNAs
(miRNAs). Thus, we performed miRNA microarray in SDF-1 stimulated B88
cells. we isolated miR-30 family which has predictive binding sites in
3'-UTR of mGluR5 mRNA in silico analysis. We now analyze the regulation
of these miRNA by MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathway.
