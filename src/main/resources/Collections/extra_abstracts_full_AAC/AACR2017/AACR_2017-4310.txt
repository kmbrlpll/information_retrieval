Title: SH003 induces apoptosis of DU145 prostate cancer cells by
inhibiting ERK-involved pathway.


Herbal medicines have been used in cancer treatment, with many exhibiting
favorable side effect and toxicity profiles compared with conventional
chemotherapeutic agents. SH003 is a novel extract from Astragalus
membranaceus, Angelica gigas, and Trichosanthes Kirilowii Maximowicz
combined at a 1:1:1 ratio that impairs the growth of breast cancer cells.
Our data demonstrate that SH003 induced apoptosis in DU145 prostate
cancer cells by inhibiting ERK signaling. SH003 induced apoptosis of
prostate cancer cells in dose-dependent manner, which was independent of
androgen dependency. SH003 also increased intracellular ROS levels but
this is not associated with its pro-apoptotic effects. SH003 inhibited
phosphorylation of Ras/Raf1/MEK/ERK/p90RSK in androgen-independent DU145
cells, but not androgen-dependent LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Moreover, ERK2
overexpression rescued SH003-induced apoptosis in DU145 cells. Thus, our
data conclude that SH003 induces apoptotic cell death of DU145 prostate
cancer cells by inhibiting ERK-mediated pathway.
