Title: Identification of a FGFR3-TACC3 fusion in esophageal cancer.


Aberrant activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has been
found to contribute to carcinogenesis. Recently, activating FGFR fusions
are detected in several malignancy. However, limited information is
available regarding the existence of FGFR fusions in esophageal squamous
cell cancer (ESCC) and gastric cancer (GC). In this report, we explored
major FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 fusion transcripts in ESCC and GC specimens
(n = 74 and 114, respectively) using a most comprehensive next-generation
sequencing panel. We detected a targetable fusion between exon 18 of
FGFR3 and exon 11 of TACC3 at a frequency of 1.4% (1/74) in ESCC, whereas
other FGFR fusions were not detected in the ESCC or GC specimens
analyzed. Furthermore, split FGFR3 signals were apparent in this specimen
by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with break-apart probes. The
patient, a 64-year-old man with unresectable T4bN3M1 poorly
differentiated ESCC of stage IV, was treated with palliative
chemoradiotherapy followed by taxane chemotherapy. The patient died of
cancer progression, with his overall survival time having been 9.5 months.

Our results provide sequence information that should prove useful for
development of simple and cost-effective diagnostic assays as an
alternative to FISH for patients with ESCC harboring the FGFR3-TACC3
fusion.
