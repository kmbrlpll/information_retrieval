Title: Alterations in gene expression after exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells
to isobutylparaben.


Parabens are a group of chemical compounds extensively used as
preservatives in consumer products such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and
processed food. Parabens have been shown to have endocrine disrupting
properties, to accumulate in breast tissue and to increase the
proliferation of hormone receptor positive breast cancer cell lines
through competitive binding to the estrogen receptor. Studies have shown
that isobutylparaben has the highest binding affinity for the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), reported to bind environmental toxins. This
study examined the alterations in gene expression correlated to exposure
of the hormone receptor negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 to
isobutylparaben over a 72 hour time frame. Exposure of the cells to
concentrations of isobutylparabens commonly found in consumer products
alters the genetic expression profile of the cells. In our study,
detectable expression levels of AhR mRNA decreased, while cytochrome P450
(CYP1A1) and receptor activator of NFÎºB ligand (RANKL) mRNA levels
increased, as analyzed by qPCR. The downregulation of AhR and altered
expression levels of invasion related genes is suggestive of an increased
metastatic phenotype with exposure to isobutylparaben.
