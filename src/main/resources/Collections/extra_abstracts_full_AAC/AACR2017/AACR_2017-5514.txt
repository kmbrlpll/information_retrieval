Title: Loss of expression of the recycling receptor, FcRn, promotes tumor
cell growth by increasing albumin consumption.


Tumor cells rely on high concentrations of amino acids to support their
growth and proliferation. Although increased macropinocytic uptake and
lysosomal degradation of the most abundant serum protein, albumin, in
Ras-transformed cells can meet these demands, it is not understood how
the majority of tumor cells that express wild type Ras achieve this. In
the current study we reveal that the neonatal Fc receptor, FcRn,
regulates tumor cell proliferation through the ability to recycle its
ligand, albumin. By contrast with normal epithelial cells, we show that
human FcRn is present at very low or undetectable levels in the majority
of tumor cell lines analyzed. Remarkably, shRNA-mediated ablation of FcRn
expression in an FcRn-positive tumor cell line results in a substantial
growth increase of tumor xenografts, whereas enforced expression of this
receptor by lentiviral transduction has the reverse effect. Moreover,
intracellular albumin and glutamate levels are increased by the loss of
FcRn-mediated recycling of albumin, combined with hypoalbuminemia in
tumor-bearing mice. These studies identify a novel role for FcRn as a
suppressor of tumor growth and have implications for the use of this
receptor as a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target.
