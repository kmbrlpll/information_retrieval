Title: Cordycepin induces apoptosis by caveolin-1-mediated JNK regulation
of Foxo3a in human lung adenocarcinoma cells.


Forkhead transcription factor (Foxo3a) is a critical effector of
JNK-mediated tumor suppression. However, it is not clear whether the
caveolin-1 (CAV1)-mediated JNK/Foxo3a pathway is involved in cancer cell
apoptosis. We found that cordycepin upregulates CAV1 expression, which
was accompanied by JNK phosphorylation (p-JNK), and, subsequently Foxo3a
translocation into the nucleus, resulting in the upregulation of Bax
protein expression. Furthermore, we found that CAV1 overexpression
upregulated p-JNK whereas CAV1 siRNA downregulated p-JNK. Additionally,
SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor, significantly increased Foxo3a
phosphorylation, which attenuated Foxo3a translocation into the nucleus,
indicating that CAV1 mediates JNK regulation of Foxo3a. Foxo3a siRNA
downregulated Bax protein and attenuated A549 apoptosis, indicating that
the CAV1-mediated JNK/Foxo3a pathway induces the apoptosis of A549 lung
cancer cells. Cordycepin significantly decreased tumor volume in nude
mice. Taken together, these results indicate that cordycepin promotes
CAV1 upregulation to enhance JNK/Foxo3a signaling pathway activation
inducing apoptosis in lung cancer cells and support its potential as a
therapeutic agent for lung cancer.
