Title: Genome-wide CRISPR screen and metabolite profiling reveal a new
mechanism of methotrexate sensitivity.


The chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (MTX) inhibits nucleotide
biosynthesis and causes cell death by blocking DNA and RNA production.
While MTX has had tremendous success as an anti-cancer treatment and is
the subject of nearly a thousand ongoing clinical trials, we do not fully
understand why certain cancers are more sensitive to it and why
resistance emerges. To study these questions, we used a CRISPR-based
genetic screen to identify genes that confer sensitivity to MTX. We
identified an enzyme that plays a key role in a metabolic pathway that
was not known to be associated with MTX sensitivity. Inhibition of the
pathway, either by genetic loss of several genes in the pathway or
through nutritional modulations, causes dramatic resistance to MTX in
cultured cancer cells. Our results improved our understanding of the
cellular response to MTX, and suggest that expression levels of enzymes
in the pathway may serve as clinical predictor for MTX response in
patients.
