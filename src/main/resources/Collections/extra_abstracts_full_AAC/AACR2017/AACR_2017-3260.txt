Title: Training for cancer surgery in Sub Saharan Africa.


BACKGROUND: Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face both training
and infrastructural challenges for surgical care, particularly for
cancer. Practitioners charged with caring for these patients have few
options for basic or advanced training.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the training options for cancer surgery in Sub
Saharan Africa

METHODS: The different methods of training are described and the
advantages and limits of each methods is highlighted.

RESULTS: Training during residency and onsite fellowship are a good
option but requires an appropriate number and capacity of training
programme. International fellowships have the limitation of readjustment
back home for the trained fellow. Onsite International training missions
like IVUmed’s missions have the advantage of “Teach One, Reach
Many” outcome where a whole team in trained in accordance of local
needs and the participation of all stakeholders.

CONCLUSIONS: Long-term program commitments; effective communication; and
a shared vision among the program site, the coordinating nongovernmental
organization, and supporting organizations facilitate the development of
thriving surgical teaching programs capable of serving local communities
and conducting outreach training.
