Title: Antagonism of D2-like dopamine receptors plays a role in
Onc201’s anticancer effects.


ONC201/TIC10 is a first-in-class small molecule inducer of TRAIL that
causes early activation of the integrated stress response and inactivates
both Akt and ERK. Its promising safety profile and broad spectrum
efficacy in vitro has been confirmed in Phase I/II trials in several
advanced malignancies. Biochemical and reporter assays have shown that
ONC201 is a selective and competitive antagonist of the D2-like
receptors, specifically, dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and dopamine
receptor D3 (DRD3) with a KD value of ~3 µM. The theme that dopamine and
dopamine receptors are important in cancer has emerged in the literature.
We hypothesize that ONC201’s interaction with DRD2 is critical for
ONC201’s anticancer effects. Co-treating HCT116 and RKO colorectal
cancer cells with ONC201 and dopamine or the selective D2-like receptor
agonist sumanirole partially abrogated ONC201-induced ATF4/CHOP
expression and apoptosis. Knocking down DRD2 expression using siRNA
negated ONC201’s effects on viable cell count. Overexpressing DRD2 in a
cancer cell line that has very low levels of DRD2, increased
ONC201-induced PARP cleavage. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that
cells that have acquired resistance to ONC201 did not express detectable
mRNA levels of the D2-like receptors. To further determine the anti-tumor
potential of targeting the D2-like receptor, we treated different cancer
cell lines with other D2-like receptor antagonists. Similar to ONC201,
the D2-selective antagonist L-741,626 decreased cell viability and
induced apoptosis in a number of cancer cell lines. In contrast to
ONC201, however, L-741,626 has a poor therapeutic index. Our findings
show that the ability of ONC201 to inhibit D2-like receptors contributes
to ONC201’s antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity. Ongoing work
is aimed at elucidating the mechanisms by which antagonism of D2-like
receptors can promote apoptotic cell death, especially with regard to
ATF4/CHOP/DR5 and Akt/ERK/Foxo3a/TRAIL, which have been shown to be
stimulated in ONC201-treated and -sensitive tumor cells.
