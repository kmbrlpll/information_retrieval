Title: Clinical performance and utilization of 3 PD-L1
immunohistochemical assays.


Three different PD-L1 immunohistochemical (IHC) assays have recently been
approved to help guide treatment decisions regarding anti-PD-1
(Keytruda®, Opdivo®) and anti-PD-L1 (Tecentriq®) immuno-oncology based
therapies. The three assays differ in the primary monoclonal antibodies
used, the assay platform (Dako, Ventana), scoring and interpretation
criteria, and intended use. Our clinical laboratories currently offer all
3 assays (pharmDx™ 22C3, pharmDx™ 28-8, and SP142) because they are
associated with different intended uses, companion and complementary
diagnostics for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and complementary
diagnostic for urothelial carcinomas (UC). In the NSCLC samples evaluated
in the first year since the approval of the two pharmDx™ assays, we
have noted a higher percentage of positive samples with the pharmDx™
28-8 assay (50%) compared to the pharmDx™ 22C3 assay (30%). This
difference is mainly due to the use of different assay cutoffs associated
with the two assays, as there is good correlation between the overall
staining patterns, including the distribution of the percentage of tumor
cells exhibiting positive staining. For the SP142 assay tested on UC
samples, 22% of the cases were considered positive. All 3 assays are
robust, with a limited number of samples considered inconclusive (Three

robust, with a limited number of samples considered inconclusive (<10%),
mainly due to an inadequate number of tumor cells. The companion
diagnostic PD-L1 assay (pharmDx™ 22C3) has had the greatest utilization
of the 3 assays, as it is required for the use of the Keytruda® in NSCLC
samples. The performance features of the 3 different PD-L1 assays in the
clinical laboratory setting has shown that all assays are robust and can
be readily scored and interpreted by the pathology team. The utilization
of the 3 assays correlates with respective intended use, tumor type and
companion versus complementary diagnostic application, for each assay.
