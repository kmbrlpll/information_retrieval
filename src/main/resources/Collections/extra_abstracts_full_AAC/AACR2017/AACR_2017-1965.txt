Title: A novel biocompatible fluorescent nanoparticle enables enhanced
live cell tagging and tracking of cancer cells.


Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer mortality. Metastasis is a
multi-step process which includes local tumor cell invasion, cell
migration into the vasculature, exit of cells from the circulation and
colonization at the distal tissue sites. Long-term noninvasive cell
tracking by fluorescent probes is of great importance to life science and
biomedical engineering. Current methods used to fluorescently tag cancer
cells have been limited by short signal duration, high background
auto-fluorescence or lengthy cell line generation using GFP. We have
developed a biocompatible fluorescent nanoparticle which relies on
Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE) technology that are highly resistant
to fluorescent signal quenching. These particles enable highly efficient
live cell fluorescent tagging while retaining fluorescent signal for up
to 10 days in vitro and 21 days in vivo. These nanoparticles will open
new avenues in the development of fluorescent probes for following
biological processes such as carcinogenesis.
