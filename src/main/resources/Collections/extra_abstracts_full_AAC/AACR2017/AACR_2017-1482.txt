Title: Triptolide inhibits the growth of osteosarcoma by regulating
microRNA-181a via targeting PTEN gene in vivo and in vitro.


Objective: We aimed to study the effect of triptolide on OS and the
related molecular mechanism.

Methods: The cell viability, apoptosis portion, tumor size, tumor weight
and invasion of OS cells were determined. The relative level of miR-181
in OS tissues and the adjacent tissues was determined by qRT-PCR. The
target gene of miR-181a was determined and verified by luciferase report
assay. At last, OS cells were treated with triptolide and triptolide +
miR-181a mimics to verify the relationship between triptolide and
miRN-181a.

Results: Triptolide inhibited the cell viability, promoted the apoptosis,
decreased the tumor size and weight, and reduced the invasion of OS
cells. The level of miR-181a in OS cells decreased significantly after
treating with triptolide, and the relative level of miR-181a in OS
tissues was markedly higher than that in the adjacent tissues. PTEN was
reported and verified the direct target gene of miR-181a. The
overexpression of miR-181a decreased the inhibition of triptolide on OS
proliferation and promotion on OS apoptosis.

Conclusion: Triptolide inhibited the proliferation of OS by regulating
miR-181a via targeting PTEN gene in vivo and vitro.
