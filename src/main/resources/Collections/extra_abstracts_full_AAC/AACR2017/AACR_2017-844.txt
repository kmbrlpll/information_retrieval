Title: PPARD downregulation in cancer cells suppresses metastases by
inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and EMT.


PPARD is upregulated in many major human cancers, but the role that its
expression in cancer cells has in metastasis remains poorly understood.
Here, we show that specific PPARD downregulation or genetic deletion of
PPARD in cancer cells significantly repressed metastasis in various
cancer models in vivo. Mechanistically, PPARD promoted angiogenesis via
interleukin 8 in vivo and in vitro. Analysis of transcriptome profiling
of HCT116 colon cancer cells with or without genetic deletion of PPARD
and gene expression patterns in The Cancer Genome Atlas colorectal
adenocarcinoma database identified novel pro-metastatic genes (GJA1, VIM,
SPARC, STC1, SNCG) as PPARD targets. PPARD expression in cancer cells
drastically affected epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and
invasion, further underscoring its necessity to metastasis. Clinically,
high PPARD expression in various major human cancers (e.g., colorectal,
lung, breast) was associated with significantly reduced metastasis-free
survival. Our results demonstrate that PPARD, a druggable protein, is an
important molecular target in metastatic cancer.
