Title: Eribulin induces cortical localization of E-cadherin, p120-catenin
and beta-catenin in breast cancer cells.


Eribulin provides a survival advantage for breast cancer patients,
particularly those with triple-negative and HER2-negative subtypes.1,2
Mechanistically, eribulin was shown to reverse epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) in breast cancer models.3 E-cadherin is a central
regulator responsible for maintenance of the epithelial phenotype and
loss of cortical E-cadherin and its downstream signaling is an early and
significant event in EMT. Short term treatment of HCC1937 breast cancer
cells with eribulin initiated cortical E-cadherin localization in manner
different from other microtubule targeting agents. Cortical E-cadherin
plays essential roles in cell adhesion and in regulating the Wnt pathway,
whose aberrant activity is implicated in EMT. At the adherens junctions
p120-catenin and β-catenin bind to E-cadherin, an interaction
facilitated by microtubules. Cortical sequestration of p120- and
β-catenin at the adherens junctions stabilizes these complexes and
inhibits their ability to stimulate signaling pathways that contribute to
EMT. We tested whether eribulin, which binds to the plus ends of
microtubules, promotes EMT reversal by influencing p120- and β-catenin
localization and activity. Our results show that eribulin induces
cortical localization of p120-catenin and β-catenin with E-cadherin in
HCC1937 cells, consistent with the formation of normal adherens
junctions. Eribulin also stimulated the phosphorylation of Ser33/37 and
Thr41 on β-catenin which promotes proteasomal degradation, which would
be expected to further inhibit oncogenic signaling. Collectively, our
results suggest that eribulin contributes to reversal of EMT through
modulation of downstream signaling initiated by cortical localization of
p120- and β-catenin at the adherens junctions. Funding for this work was
