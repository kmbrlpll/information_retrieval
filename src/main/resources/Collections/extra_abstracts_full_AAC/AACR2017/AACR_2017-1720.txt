Title: Circulating tumor cell (CTC) enrichment and DNA mutation detection
by sequencing.


Molecular analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is hindered by low
sensitivity and high level of background leukocytes of currently
available CTC enrichment technologies. The Celsee PREP100 device captures
CTCs with high sensitivity and allows the captured CTCs to be retrieved
for molecular analysis. To evaluate the potential of utilizing PREP100 in
CTC molecular analysis, we first prepared mock samples using cultured
prostate cancer cells PC3 and LnCAP and analyzed captured cells by PCR
amplicon sequencing. Using Celsee PREP100, we were able to recover the
average of 79% (ranging from 40% to 100%) of 110 - 1,100 PC3 cells and 60
- 1,500 LnCAP cells and detect p.K139fs*3 deletion in PC3 cells and T877A
mutation in LnCAP cells. In addition, we also spiked in the two cell
lines into normal donor blood samples and analyzed the captured cells by
PCR amplicon sequencing. Preliminary experiments showed that 40% of 250
spiked PC3 cells and 74% of 50 spiked LnCAP cells were captured. Further,
we were able to detect p.K139fs*3 deletion in the retrieved 50 - 1,000
spiked PC3 cells. Our results illustrate that Celsee PREP100 system
represents a promising technology for capturing and molecular
characterization of CTCs.
