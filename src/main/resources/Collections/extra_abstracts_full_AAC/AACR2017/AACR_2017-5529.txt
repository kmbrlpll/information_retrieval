Title: CD177 suppresses breast cancer progression by regulating the
canonical WNT Î²-Catenin pathway.


To better treat breast cancer patients, it is imperative to be able to
predict breast cancer relapse and metastasis. Here, we identified the
cluster of differentiation 177 (CD177) expression is positively
correlated with relapse-free and metastasis-free survival of breast
cancer patients. CD177 protein is highly expressed in normal breast
epithelial cells and is significantly reduced in invasive cancers. Using
mouse models, we found that CD177 suppresses breast cancer, primarily by
forming a complex with E-Cadherin and b-Catenin at adherens junctions.
The physical interaction prevents the activation of b-Catenin-mediated
transcription by the canonical WNT signaling as demonstrated by a
TOP-flash dual luciferase assay. In conclusion, we have identified CD177
as a novel breast cancer suppressor and uncovered a new regulatory
mechanism for the canonical WNT/b-Catenin-mediated oncogenic signaling
transduction.
