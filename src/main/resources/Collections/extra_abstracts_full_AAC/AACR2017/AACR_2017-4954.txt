Title: Clinical validation of a cell-free DNA liquid biopsy approach for
noninvasive molecular profiling.


Clinical molecular profiling of advanced cancers enables the
identification of actionable genomic alterations to guide therapeutic
decisions. Although profiling of tissue samples is considered the gold
standard, specimens may be unavailable or unsuitable for testing due to
limited tumor purity or specimen quality. Further, genetically informed
treatment decisions are increasingly necessary after disease progression
and re-biopsy in this setting may not be feasible. Circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) approaches for identification of genetic alterations in cancer
patients may be more informative as the alterations reflect the current
status of the tumor. ctDNA is representative of multiple tumor sites
within a patient and may aid in the detection of alterations throughout
the course of therapy. However, the fraction of ctDNA obtained from a
blood sample is often very low (99% at MAFs of ≥20% and ≥0.50%,
respectively. PlasmaSelect64 provides a non-invasive platform to enable
detection of clinically relevant genetic alterations across a large
number of genomic regions to aid in the therapeutic management of cancer
patients.
