Title: The potential of Lactobacillus probiotic treatments in colorectal
cancer (CRC).


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of death worldwide. It
is known to be a type of cancer that is preventable by changes in diet
and lifestyle. Mounting evidence are supporting the role of gut
microbiome in the etiology of CRC and emphasize on the potential of
probiotics as biotherapeutics in the prevention and management of CRC.
Lactobacillus probiotic bacteria were suggested to balance pathogenic and
oncogenic microbial community in the colon and produce anti-tumorigenic
and anti-inflammatory effects in healthy individuals at risk and CRC
patients. There is a need, however, for studies that focus on identifying
potent probiotic strains with activity against CRC and inhibit cancer
growth. This report discusses and present findings about the formulation
of novel probiotic Lactobacillus biotherapeutic for CRC based on anti-CRC
proliferative effect, immune modulation and metabolic activity, in vitro
and in vivo, using a genetically-induced animal CRC model. Results and
metabolomic analysis demonstrated the potential acrion of probiotic
treatment to change host and gut microbiome co-metabolic profiles,
produce local and systemic anti-inflammatory effects, inhibit
cancer-causing events, and improve overall gut health.
