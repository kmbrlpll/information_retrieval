Title: The use of self nano-emulsifying drug delivery systems to improve
bioavailability of combination therapy and overcome erlotinib resistance
in non-small cell lung cancer.


Background:Erlotinib, an EGFR selective reversible inhibitor, improved
response of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
with 70% of patients showing significant tumor regression upon treatment.
Unfortunately,most patients eventually relapse due to development of
resistance. Our research goal is to quantify the effects of combination
treatment of erlotinib with a glycyrrhetinic acid analogs and to improve
the oral bioavailability of this treatment using self nano-emulsifying
drug delivery systems.

Methods: NSCLC cell lines HCC827, HCC827 (4µM erlotinib resistant),
HCC827 Cl4 (second site EGFR mutated), HCC827BEAS2B, and H1975
(4µMerlotinib resistant) were treated in combination with CDODA-Me,
CF3CDODA-Me and Erlotinib. The cell viability assays were performed and
combination index (CI) values were calculated by isobolographic analysis.
Self nano-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDs) were formulated and
characterized through in vitro and in vivo studies.

Results: CF3CDODA and improved efficacy for erlotinib in all cell lines
with IC50 values of 6.0µM, 7.8µM, 4.6µM and 4.2±1.56µM for
HCC827(RESISTANT), H1975(RESISTANT), HCC827CL4 and HCC827 respectively
compared to IC50values of erlotinib alone (25µM, 21µM, 23µM, and
8µM). This was superior when compared to IC50 values of CDODA-Me
combination treatment (6.66µM, 7.32µM, 12.06µM, and 5.45µM
respectively). Combination treatment showed strong synergism with a
constant concentration of 0.5µM CF3CDODA and CI values of 0.461, 0.548,
0.389, 0.550 for HCC827 4µM, H1975µM, HCC827CL4, and HCC827
respectively and antagonism in HCC827BEAS2B (1.508) cells. This is
comparable to the synergism observed at a minimum concentration of 2µM
CDODA-Me with CI values of 0.337, 0.67, 0.64, and 0.657 respectively and
antagonism CI of 1.175 for HCC827BEAS2B. CF3CDODA Combination therapy
showed a 2.5-fold decrease in colony formation in resistant cells making
them comparable to wild type. This was comparable to CDODA-Me combination
treatment with a 1.46-fold decrease in colony formation. Both combination
treatments showed little effect on HCC827BEAS2B. Western Blot analysis
showed decrease MET expression and decreased apoptosis inhibiting markers
BCL2 and Survivin. SNEDD formulations increased maximum drug plasma
concentrations for Erlotinib (281ng/ml to 442ng/ml) and circulating time
as well (12hrs - 21hrs).

Conclusions: Based on the results of these studies, CDODA-Me and CF3CDODA
have shown to overcome erlotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer
and when combining these treatments with the use of SNEDDS, they have
shown to be a promising treatment regimen.
