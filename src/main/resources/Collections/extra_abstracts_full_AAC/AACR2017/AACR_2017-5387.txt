Title: Droplet digital PCR for sensitive quantification of DNA
methylation in non-invasive material: Development of a robust control.


Background: Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a highly sensitive method for
quantification of nucleic acids, with great potential for detection of
biomarkers present in low quantities. As for DNA methylation analyses
using ddPCR, there is no consensus on whether or not a control should be
included. The aim of the present study was to; 1) demonstrate that use of
a control is essential in such analyses, and 2) develop a robust control
with better performance than the existing alternatives.

Results and methods: A 4-gene control panel was developed in our lab, and
its performance compared to the existing alternatives ACTB and C-LESS-C1.
This was done through analyzing the methylation level of four target
genes in DNA from 34 colon cancer cell lines. All ddPCRs were performed
using the QX200â„¢ PCR platform (BioRad). Details will be presented.

Conclusions: In summary, use of a control is essential for robust and
consistent ddPCR based DNA methylation, and can prevent erroneous
interpretation of technical artifacts.
