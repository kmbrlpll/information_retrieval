Title: USP26 regulates TGF-β signaling by deubiquitinating and
stabilizing SMAD7.


The amplitude of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signal is tightly
regulated to ensure appropriate physiological responses. As part of
negative feedback loop SMAD7, a direct transcriptional target of
downstream TGF-β signaling, acts as a scaffold to recruit the E3 ligase
SMURF2 to target the TGF-β receptor complex for ubiquitin mediated
degradation. Here we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme USP26 as a
novel integral component of this negative feedback loop. We demonstrate
that TGF-β rapidly enhances the expression of USP26 and reinforces SMAD7
stability by limiting the ubiquitin mediated turnover of SMAD7.
Conversely, knockdown of USP26 rapidly degrades SMAD7 resulting in TGF-β
receptor stabilization and enhanced levels of p-SMAD2. Clinically, loss
of USP26 correlates with high TGF-β activity and confers poor prognosis
in glioblastoma. Our data identify USP26 as a novel negative regulator of
the TGF-β pathway and suggests that loss of USP26 expression may be an
important factor in glioblastoma pathogenesis.
