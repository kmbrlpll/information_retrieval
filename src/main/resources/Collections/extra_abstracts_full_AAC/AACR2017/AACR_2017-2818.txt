Title: PDX model of the enriched pleural effusion from advanced lung
cancer patient for testing on targeted drug sensitivity and resistance.


Advanced lung cancer of late stage patients is selectively sensitive to
available targeted therapeutics and often developing resistance to the
early sensitive drug treatment. Surgery tumor tissues are usually not
available to establish patient derived xenograft (PDX) models which is
critical to evaluate drug sensitivity and resistance. We applied CD45
magnet beads to enrich the tumor cell population from pleural effusion
specimens of advanced lung cancer. Seven PDX models were successfully
established in this way. Based on genetic profiling of these models, TKI
drug related EGFR mutations and ALK fusion were confirmed (EGFR: L858R,
T790M, Exon 19 insertion; ALK fusion). Further in vivo efficacy studies
were designed to test on multiple drug sensitivity and resistance
including Gefitinib, Erlotinib, Ceritinib, Alectinib, AZD9291. Tumor
growth inhibition (TGI) were well matched with corresponding gene
mutations among the models. In particularly, T790M model was resistant to
Erlotinib and quite sensitive for AZD9291. In conclusion, the models
established here are very useful to test on potency of many current
investigational TKI drugs and provide base for drug resistant model
establishment.
