Title: Regorafenib (StivargaÂ®) reverses BCRP-mediated multidrug
resistance in vitro and in vivo.


Overexpression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) has been shown
to produce multidrug resistance (MDR) in various kinds of cancers, such
as breast, colon, lung and ovarian cancers. Regorafenib, an oral
multi-kinase inhibitor, was found to have inhibitory effects on
BCRP-mediated MDR both in vitro and in vivo. Regorafenib significantly
sensitized BCRP-overexpressing cancerous cells to BCRP substrates by
increasing their intracellular accumulation. There are no significant
changes in the expression level or the subcellular distribution of BCRP
in the cells exposed to regorafenib. Our mechanism studies revealed that
regorafenib inhibited the ATP-driven efflux function of BCRP. Our
induced-fit docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggested the
existence of strong and stable interactions between regorafenib and BCRP
protein. Animal study revealed that the combination of regorafenib and
topotecan resulted in great inhibitory effects on the growth of S1-M1-80
xenograft tumors. Regorafenib significantly increased the intratumoral
concentration of topotecan but had no significant effects on topotecan
plasma concentration. In conclusion, our study indicated that regorafenib
could be useful in combating multidrug resistance in cancer treatments.
