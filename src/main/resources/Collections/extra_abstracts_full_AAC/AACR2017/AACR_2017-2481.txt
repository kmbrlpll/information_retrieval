Title: RAD51 and AICDA define a new synthetic lethal interaction that is
targetable in multiple tumor types.


Antigen stimulated B-cells transiently express Activation Induced
Cytidine Deaminase (AID) which initiates point mutations and DNA double
strand breaks (DSB) in immunoglobulin genes to promote B-cell maturation.
However, AID is capable of broadly damaging the B-cell genome. We have
shown that AID-induced DSBs require the homologous recombination factor
RAD51 for their repair. Using genetic approaches, we discovered that
reduced HR function is cytotoxic to AID-expressing B-cells. We
subsequently demonstrated the feasibility of small molecule inhibition of
RAD51 to sensitize AID-overexpressing tumor cells. Here we build on those
observations, finding that AID-RAD51 synthetic lethality occurs via
mitotic catastrophe, involving the mTOR pathway. We have now developed
potent and selective RAD51 modulatory small molecules that preferentially
kill AID-expressing tumor cells. Using mouse models of lymphoma and
leukemia we provide in vivo efficacy data demonstrating the potential
therapeutic feasibility of RAD51 modulation. These studies provide
evidence for a novel “synthetic lethal” approach for treating
AID-expressing malignancies, via the induction of mitotic catastrophe.
