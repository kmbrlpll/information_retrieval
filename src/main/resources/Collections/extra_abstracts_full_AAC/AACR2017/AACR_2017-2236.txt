Title: High-throughput screen for chemopreventative agents that influence
adipose-tissue driven epithelial neoplastic transformation.


Epidemiological studies have established a link between excess adiposity
and cancer risk. Our previous data demonstrate that adipose tissue
stimulates the transformation (steps a cell undergoes to become
malignant) of both skin and mammary epithelial cells as measured by
anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Therefore, agents that
influence growth in soft agar may be used therapeutically for skin and
breast cancer prevention. However, soft agar in a 24-well format is
unsuitable for high-throughput screens. Our objective was to develop a
high-throughput assay to evaluate chemopreventative agents that influence
adipose-tissue driven epithelial neoplastic transformation. We
demonstrate that growth in low attachment conditions in a 384-well plate
format is strongly correlated with growth in soft agar. We utilized this
methodology and discovered the ability of several compounds to inhibit
adipose tissue-stimulated transformation. These compounds will be used in
vivo in our models of adipose tissue- or HFD-promoted tumor formation.
