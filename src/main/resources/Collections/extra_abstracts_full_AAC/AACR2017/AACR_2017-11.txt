Title: The oncolytic peptide LTX-315 enhances T cell clonality and
induces synergy with chemotherapy.


LTX-315, a novel oncolytic peptide is effective against both
drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cancer cells with lower toxicity
towards normal cells. Intratumoral treatment with LTX-315 results in
growth inhibition, complete regression and long lasting tumor-specific
immune responses.

The oncolytic effect of LTX-315 involves perturbation of the plasma
membrane and distortion of intracellular organelles including the
mitochondria with subsequent release of Damage-Associated Molecular
Pattern molecules (DAMPs) such as ATP, cytochrome c and HMGB1. LTX-315
effectively induces necrosis within the tumor followed by the release of
tumor antigens as demonstrated by a greater increase in tumor
infiltrating CD8+ T cells, expansion of T cell clonality, and number of
clones within the tumor microenvironment.

LTX-315`s ability to modify the tumor microenvironment makes it ideal as
a combination partner for other cancer therapies, including chemotherapy
and immune checkpoint inhibitors.

In preclinical tumor models, combination of LTX-315 and chemotherapeutic
agents such as cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin demonstrates significant
synergy.
