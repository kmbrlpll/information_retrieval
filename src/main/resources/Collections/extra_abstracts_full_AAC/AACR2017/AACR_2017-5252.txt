Title: Quercetin inhibits prostate cancer by modulating ROS and key
regulators of apoptosis and cell survival.


Long latency and indolent nature of prostate cancer (PCa) provides a
window of opportunity for preventive interventions using natural and
synthetic agents. Hence, the focus of this study was to ascertain the
chemopreventive role of Quercetin, a bioflavonoid, commonly used to treat
prostatitis. Human PCa cells (LNCaP, DU145 and PC3) were treated with
different concentrations of Quercetin and its effect on cell survival and
apoptosis was determined by MTT assay. Human PCa cells treated with
Quercetin showed significant reduction in cell viability and
proliferation compared with untreated controls, which was dose and time
dependent. In addition to this our FACS analysis showed higher percentage
of apoptotic cells after Quercetin treatment compared to untreated cells.
Quercetin induced apoptosis in PCa cells is a cumulative effect of
modulation of key apoptotic proteins, changes in mitochondrial membrane
potential and ROS production. Our results demonstrate that Quercetin is a
potent chemopreventive agent, which may improve outcomes of PCa by
inhibiting mechanisms involved in tumor progression.
