Title: Wip1 constrains p53 activity during embryogenesis to permit normal
neuronal development.


The oncoproteins MDM2 and Wip1 (PPM1D) each negatively regulate tumor
suppressor p53 activity and overexpression of either promotes
tumorigenesis. Both MDM2 and PPM1D genes are characteristically induced
by p53 following exposure to DNA damage and both negatively regulate p53,
but by different mechanisms. In mice, homozygous deletion of Mdm2 is
embryonically lethal (E5.5-E6.5) resulting from excess p53-dependent
apoptosis, whereas Ppm1d-/- embryos exhibit partial mid-gestation
lethality. To investigate the role of p53 in the partial lethality of
Ppm1d-/- embryos, we generated an endogenous Ppm1d promoter
β-galactosidase reporter allele, Ppm1dΔ3(LacZ), and a new Ppm1d
knockout allele, Ppm1dΔ3. We also generated Trp53-/-Ppm1dΔ3/Δ3 double
knockout embryos and mice. From Ppm1d+/Δ3 × Ppm1d+/Δ3 crosses,
approximately 40% of Ppm1dΔ3/Δ3 embryos die between E10.5 and E12.5 and
an additional 40% die shortly after birth, leading to the survival of
only approximately 20% of Ppm1dΔ3/Δ3 pups to adulthood. Sections of
Ppm1d+/Δ3(LacZ) embryos show dispersed LacZ staining activity with
regions of higher activity, especially in specific regions of developing
neuronal tissues. The developing neural tissues of Ppm1dΔ3/Δ3 embryos
are characterized by distorted cellular architecture, cell dropout, and
dark, pyknotic nuclei. Although the frequency of apoptotic cells was
nearly three-fold higher in Ppm1dΔ3/Δ3 compared with Ppm1d+/+ embryos

The specific phenotypes of excess mid-gestation embryonic lethality,
excess neuronal apoptosis, and deficient ventricular and sub-ventricular
pHH3 cell numbers, but not excess in γ-H2AX foci numbers, were rescued
by loss of p53 in Trp53-/-Ppm1dΔ3/Δ3 embryos. These results support a
specific function of Wip1 in regulating p53 activity to ensure normal
development of the brain and spinal cord during embryogenesis.
