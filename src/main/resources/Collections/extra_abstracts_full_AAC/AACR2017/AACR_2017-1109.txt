Title: MutSα and MutSβ mismatch repair complexes differentially
regulate temozolomide efficacy & sensitizing effects of veliparib in
glioblastoma cells.


Mismatch repair (MMR) is essential for temozolomide (TMZ) sensitivity,
and MMR deficiency causes TMZ resistance and disease recurrence. However,
the role MMR in TMZ response has been linked with Msh2/Msh6 (MutSα),
while role of Msh3, a component of MutSβ remains unclear. To delineate
role of MutSα and MutSβ in TMZ response, we used siRNA to disrupt MSH6
and MSH3 expression. As expected, silencing of MSH6 led to resistance in
a TMZ-sensitive U251 cell line. In contrast, silencing of MSH3 enhanced
TMZ sensitivity as compared to the control cells. These results support
established role of MutSα in TMZ response via replication stress and DNA
double strand breaks (DSB), and reveal that MutSβ may potentially
influence TMZ response by modulating DSB repair. Consistently, host cell
reactivation (HCR) assays in U251 expressing DRGFP reporter showed
decreased homologous recombination (HR) after MSH3 knockdown (KD), while
Msh6 KD had no effect on HR efficiency. Supporting the concept of
synthetic lethality of HR with PARP inhibition, clinically relevant dose
of veliparib (1 µM) showed a modest but consistent increase in TMZ
sensitization measured in terms of potentiation factor (PF, ratio of
relative growth with TMZ alone/ TMZ and veliparib) in MSH3 KD (PF
1.6±0.2) as compared to control cells (PF 1.1±0.2). Sensitizing effect
of 1 µM veliparib in MSH6 KD (PF 1.7±0.5) was comparable to that in
MSH3 KD cells. Interestingly, supra-therapeutic dose of veliparib (10
µM) induced more pronounced sensitization in MSH6 KD cells (PF 2.6±0.3)
as compared to MSH3 KD (PF 2.4±0.3) or control cells (PF 1.6±0.2).
Consistently, veliparib (10 µM) alone had no impact on DNA damage
signaling, while TMZ induced prominent increase in phosphorylation of
KAP1, Chk1 and Chk2 in control and MSH3 KD cells, but not in MSH6 KD
cells; veliparib/TMZ co-treatment led a robust signaling in all 3 types
of cells. Increased sensitization by veliparib after MSH3 KD was also
examined in a TMZ-resistant (GBM22TMZ) PDX model carrying resistance due
to a homozygous mutation in MSH6, and a 4-fold increase in HR efficiency.
In clonogenic assays silencing of MSH3 or BRCA1 had no effect on TMZ
sensitivity in GBM22TMZ cells. However, veliparib alone (10 µM)
decreased colony formation with relative colony formation 0.54±0.03 and
0.32±0.06 in MSH3 and BRCA1 KD cells, respectively as compared to
0.82±0.04 in controls. TMZ/veliparib co-treatment in GBM22TMZ led to
further decrease in colony formation in MSH3 KD and BRCA1 KD cells with
relative colony formation of 0.30±0.04 and 0.19±0.02, respectively
versus 0.46±0.03 in control. Taken together, our results suggest that
MutSα and MutSβ differentially regulate cytotoxic effects of TMZ.
Decreased HR efficiency and enhanced sensitizing effects of veliparib in
MSH3 KD cells partially define synthetic lethality of MMR deficiency with
PARP, and may help development of PARP inhibitors as sensitizer of TMZ
therapy in GBM.
