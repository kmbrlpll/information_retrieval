Title: Long lasting inhibition of TGF-β receptor Type 1 inhibitor
(TGF-β R1) for treatment of pancreatic cancer.


Pancreatic cancer stroma is a high component of total tumor volume and
activators of fibro-genesis such as Transforming growth factor-β
(TGF-β) are abundantly secreted by pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) to
the tumor microenvironment. Aberrant TGF-β signaling pathways are
associated with many human diseases, including bone diseases,
immune-suppression, fibrosis, cancer progression and metastasis. However,
the precise mechanism of this phenomenon in pancreatic cancer remains
unclear. In this study we hypothesized that inhibition of TGF-β Type I
receptor kinase (TGF-β R1) in pancreatic cancer and stellate cells
regulates proliferation and fibrosis through the regulation of TGF-β R1
signaling pathway in PC cells, resulting in decreased migration, and
decreased proliferation. We analyzed a TGF-β R1 data set of PC patients
from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Furthermore, the analysis of a panel of
pancreatic cancer cell lines showed that TGFR-Β1 at mRNA and protein
levels were higher in PC cells when compared with human pancreatic duct
epithelial (HPDE) normal cells. In vitro cell viability, growth,
cell-cycle progression, migration, invasion and apoptosis, as well as in
vivo therapeutic effectiveness in murine xenograft models, were also
assessed following the inhibition of TGF-β R1 in pancreatic cancer and
stellate cells. The experimental validation identifies TGFR-β1
associated with PC survival. Significant inhibition of cell growth,
invasion, migration, angiogenesis and fibro-genesis. Furthermore,
treatment with LY-DMPC:DMPG-MSV inhibited growth of CAPAN-II tumors.
These findings identify TGFR-β1 as a potential therapeutic target in
pancreatic cancers expressing high levels of this oncogenic protein.
