Title: PDGFR beta signaling is required for hypoxia induced mitophagy in
glioblastoma survival.


BACKGROUND: Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling plays a key
role in gliomagenesis. Glioblastomas express all PDGF ligands and both
cell membrane receptors, PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, that are involved in
pro-survival autocrine and paracrine loops. Our previous work
demonstrated that expression of PDGFRβ is enriched in hypoxic
glioblastoma tumor tissues. Also, induction of mitophagy is a well-known
critical coping response to tissue hypoxia. We therefore investigated the
role of PDGFRβ signaling cascade in regulating hypoxia-induced mitophagy
of glioblastoma.

METHODS: Protein detection was performed by immunoblotting and
immunofluorescence to determine changes in levels of target proteins upon
RNA interference, treatment with PDGFRβ inhibitor, and ectopic gene
transfection. MitoSox assay was used to measure mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species (ROS). Tumor growth assays were performed in vitro and in
vivo using subcutaneous tumor implantation model.

RESULTS: PDGFRβ signaling was essential for induction of
hypoxia-mediated mitophagy in glioblastoma cells. Nix, a hypoxic
responsive protein and regulator of mitophagy, was necessary for
PDGFRβ-mediated glioblastoma survival. Inhibition of PDGFRβ signaling
pathway killed glioblastoma cells by suppressing mitophagy and leading to
subsequent elevation of mitochondrial ROS. Furthermore, interference of
mitophagic response by blocking PDGFRβ signaling enhanced cell death
even in chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells.

CONCLUSION: This work suggests a potential mechanism by which PDGFRβ
inhibition could kill glioblastoma cells through suppression of
NIX-mediated mitophagy. Manipulation of NIX and PDGFRβ pathway may
provide novel therapeutic opportunities in chemoresistant tumor models.
