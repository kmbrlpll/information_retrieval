Title: Nuclear localization of the caspase 3 cleaved form of p73 in
anoikis.


The transcription factor p73 is a homologue of p53 that can be expressed
as pro- or anti-apoptotic isoforms. Unlike p53, p73 is rarely mutated or
lost in cancers and it is found to replace defective p53 inducing
apoptosis. Here, we investigated the p73 involvement in anoikis, a type
of apoptosis caused by inadequate cell-matrix interactions. Breast cancer
cell lines with different p53 status were treated with doxorubicin or
docetaxel and cells detached from the extracellular matrix were analyzed.
We demonstrate for the first time that doxorubicin-induced cell
detachment is associated with p73 cleavage and caspase activation,
independently of the p53 status. However, we did not detect p73 cleavage
or caspase activation in detached cells under docetaxel treatment.
Overexpressing the apoptotic isoform of p73 led to cell detachment
associated with p73 cleavage and caspase activation. Interestingly, p73
cleaved forms localize to the nucleus during the late phase of cell death
indicating an increase in the transcriptional activity. Our study
suggests that the cleavage of p73 on specific sites may release its
pro-apoptotic function and contribute to cell death.
