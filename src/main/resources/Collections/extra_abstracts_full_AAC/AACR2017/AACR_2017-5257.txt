Title: Cellular pharmacology of curcumin cellular pharmacology of
curcumin±piperine.


Rationale: Prior reports have suggested that piperine, the major alkaloid
product derived from black and long pepper, enhances curcumin’s cancer
preventive efficacy in vitro and in vivo by an intracellular
pharmacokinetic interaction; yet, no previous studies have explored the
pharmacokinetic interactions between curcumin and piperine.

Methods: We incubated non-transformed breast cell line MCF10A and breast
cancer SUM149 cell line with different concentrations of curcumin,
piperine or curcumin + piperine to assess cell viability using a MTT
assay. For curcumin and piperine uptake assays, we incubated MCF10A,
SUM149 and MCF7 breast cells with either 5 µM curcumin or 5 µM curcumin
+ 5 µM piperine for 0.5, 1, 4,6,8,12 and 24 h, or with 15 µM curcumin
or 15 µM curcumin + 10 µM piperine for 0.17, 0.5, 1,2 and 4h. Media and
cell lysates were extracted for assay of intracellular curcumin and
piperine by LC-MS/MS. ALDH+ , ALDH-CD44+24- cells were collected via
FACS, incubated with 15 µM curcumin or 15 µM curcumin + 10 µM piperine
for 1 hour. Cell lysates and media were assayed for curcumin, curcumin
degradation and metabolic products and quantified using LC-MS/MS.

Results: 90.7±0.06% and 34.8 ±0.002% of cells were viable after
incubating MCF10A and SUM149 cells respectively with 25 µM curcumin
compared to DMSO control. Incubation with 10 µM Piperine enhanced the
antiproliferative effect of 15 µM curcumin by 33.6±0.015% (PResults:

antiproliferative effect of 15 µM curcumin by 33.6±0.015% (P< 0.05) and
16.3±0.003% (PResults: 90.7±0.06% and 34.8 ±0.002% of cells were
viable after incubating MCF10A and SUM149 cells respectively with 25 µM

enhanced the antiproliferative effect of 15 µM curcumin by 33.6±0.015%
(P< 0.05) and 16.3±0.003% (P<0.05) in SUM149 and MCF10A cells
respectively. We found no significant increase of intracellular
concentration of curcumin when coincubated with piperine in the MCF10A,
MCF7 and SUM149 cells or in the ALDH+ and the ALDH- CD44+CD24- SUM149
cells. Curcumin intracellular concentration was 166.7±22 and 151.5±24
ng/mg protein in ALDH+ cells for curcumin alone or curcumin + piperine
respectively and 130±25.4 and 135±27.4 ng/mg protein in ALDH-
CD44+CD24- for curcumin alone or curcumin + piperine respectively in
SUM149 cell line. Curcumin uptake was lower in MCF10A cells than SUM149
cells. The intracellular curcumin concentration after 1 hour incubation
with 5 µM curcumin was 11.8±0.8 and 68.1±11.2 in MCF10A and SUM149
cells respectively. Tetrahydrocurcumin and curcumin sulfate conjugates
were the major metabolites detected in MCF7 and SUM149 cell lines.
Curcumin sulfate is detectable in the media as early as 0.5h, it
increases from 1.36±0.06 and 1.43±0.05 after 0.5h to 22.6±0.53 and
23±2.2 ng/ml after 4 h for curcumin and curcumin + piperine respectively
in the media of ALDH-CD44+Cd24- SUM149 cells.

Conclusions: We find no significant difference in intracellular curcumin
concentration between cells treated with curcumin alone or curcumin +
piperine after incubation times up to 24 hr. The additive cellular
toxicity effects observed with piperine + curcumin is not pharmacokinetic
(associated with efflux pump inhibition) but rather pharmacodynamic due
to piperine’s independent anti-proliferative effects.
