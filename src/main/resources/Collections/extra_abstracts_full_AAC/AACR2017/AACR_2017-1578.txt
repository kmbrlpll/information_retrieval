Title: Distinct expression and biological functions of PMEPA1 isoforms in
prostate cancer.


Introduction and Objectives: The androgen receptor (AR) and TGF-β
dysfunctions contribute to prostate cancer (CaP) development and
progression. Our laboratory since the discovery of PMEPA1, has
established PMEPA1/NEDD4 and AR negative feedback loop and its role in AR
regulation in prostate cancer. PMEPA1 gene has also identified as a
TGF-β responsive gene and inhibits TGF-β signaling via a negative
feedback loop. Five isoforms are transcribed from distinct promoters
within the PMEPA1 locus. PMEPA1 isoforms were shown to have variations at
the N-terminus of the protein. Our previous study has shown the
differential correlations of 2 PMEPA isoforms (PMEPA1 and STAG1) in
context of AR expression in CaP. This study focuses on understanding of
the expression and biological functions of PMEPA1 isoforms in CaP.

Methods: RNA-Seq data from LNCaP and VCaP cells, and from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, were used to evaluate the expression levels
of PMEPA1 isoforms. LNCaP cells were treated with R1881 (0, 0.1, 1.0 nM)
and DU-145 and PC-3 cells were treated with TGF-β (0, 5 and 25 ng/ml)
for 24 hours. PMEPA1 isoform specific plasmids and siRNAs were
transfected into LNCaP, DU-145 and PC-3 cells individually. Cell growth
was analyzed by cell counting and BrdU incorporation assay. The protein
levels of PMEPA1 isoforms and AR were detected by immunoblotting, and the
transcript levels were evaluated by QRT-PCR.

Results: Since the annotation of PMEPA1/TMEPA1 isoforms has been
empirical in the literature, here we propose a new structure/expression
based nomenclature: PMEPA1 (reading frame of 252 amino acids (aa));
PMEPA2 (344aa); PMEPA3 (287aa; STAG1); PMEPA4 (259aa); and PMEPA5
(237aa). Expression of PMEPA1 and PMEPA2 was restricted to androgen
responsive prostate cancer cells in comparison to broader expression
pattern of other isoforms (PMEPA3-5). The expression of PMEPA1-2 was
androgen regulated, whereas expression of PMEPA 3-5 was regulated by
TGF-β. Only PMEPA1 inhibited cell growth of LNCaP, DU-145 and PC-3
cells. In contrast, PMEPA2-4 promoted cell growth of DU-145 and PC-3
cells. Of all the isoforms only PMEPA1 mediated AR protein degradation in
CaP.

Conclusions: The PMEPA isforms appear to underscore distinct biological
functions in the context of androgen and TGF-β signaling. Widely studied
PMEPA1 was specific for AR degradation in prostate cancer cells and was
consistent with previous observations of association of AR upregulation
with loss of PMEPA1 in prostate cancer. The roles of PMEPA isoforms need
to be better defined in prostate cancer and other cancers.
