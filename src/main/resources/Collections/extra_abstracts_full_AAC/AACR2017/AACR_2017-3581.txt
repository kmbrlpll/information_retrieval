Title: GATK ACNV: allelic copy-number variation discovery from SNPs and
coverage data.


The presence of somatic copy-number alterations in tumor genomes can be
used to predict both patient sensitivity to treatments as well as
outcomes. The inclusion of allelic data improves statistical power to
detect copy-number events and allows for discovery of copy-neutral
events. We present GATK ACNV, an allelic copy-number variation method
built on the Genome Analysis Toolkit. ACNV is a tool for detecting
somatic copy-number activity from whole exome and whole genome sequencing
data by segmenting the genome into regions of constant copy number and
estimating copy ratio and minor-allele fraction in those regions.

ACNV uses a novel probabilistic model to account for reference bias
(optionally using a panel of normals), which improves the estimation of
minor-allele fraction. We combine this with the coverage model from GATK
CNV by segmenting with a unified hidden Markov model, improving the
statistical power to detect copy-number variation.

We validate ACNV using a purity series of the cell line HCC1143 and
cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our results show that ACNV
is able to discover regions of somatic copy-number activity accurately
and with high resolution in both whole exome and whole genome sequencing
data.
