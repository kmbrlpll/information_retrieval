Title: Ceftriaxone, an FDA-approved cephalosporin antibiotic, suppresses
lung cancer growth by targeting Aurora B.


Ceftriaxone, an FDA-approved third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic,
has antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative
organisms. Generally, ceftriaxone is used for a variety of infections
such as community-acquired pneumonia, meningitis and gonorrhea. Its
primary molecular targets are the penicillin-binding proteins. However,
other activities of ceftriaxone remain unknown. Herein, we report for the
first time that ceftriaxone has antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo.
Kinase profiling results predicted that Aurora B might be a potential
‘off’ target of ceftriaxone. Pull-down assay data confirmed that
ceftriaxone could bind with Aurora B in vitro and in A549 cells.
Furthermore, ceftriaxone (500 µM) suppressed anchorage-independent cell
growth by targeting Aurora B in A549, H520 and H1650 lung cancer cells.
Importantly, in vivo xenograft animal model results showed that
ceftriaxone effectively suppressed A549 and H520 lung tumor growth by
inhibiting Aurora B. These data suggest the anticancer efficacy of
ceftriaxone for the treatment of lung cancers through its inhibition of
Aurora B.
