Title: Unveil the role of cell-free circulating microRNA in lung cancer.


We previously reported the identification of a signature composed by 34
serum circulating cell-free microRNAs (cf-miRNA) diagnostic for lung
cancer. Using this signature, we developed a blood test (miR-test) which
was capable of detecting asymptomatic lung cancer in a large cohort
(N>1000) of high-risk individuals (>50years and smokers). Interestingly,
we now found that a fraction (~30%) of these cf-miRNAs were
preferentially expressed in cells of epithelial origin, while another
~30% were more expressed in hematopoietic cells. We reasoned that this
cf-miRNA signature could result from the extracellular release of miRNAs
from cancer epithelial cells as well as from immune/stromal cells
composing the tumor microenvironment. We developed an integrated strategy
for the identification of the origin of cf-miRNAs through combined
analysis of published circulating and intracellular miRNAs expression
datasets (microarray and qRT-PCR based) and of NGS analysis of cf-miRNAs
in lung tumors. Our approach will contribute elucidating the biological
role of cf-miRNAs in lung cancer and explore eventual therapeutic
implications.
