Title: Cyclopamine sensitizes endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated
increase of death receptor 5 and survivin degradation in trail-resistant
gastric cancer cells.


Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has
been known as one of the most effective cancer treatment owing to its
selective killing effect of cancer but not normal cells. However it has
been reported that several gastric cancer cells showed resistance to
TRAIL because of scarcity of death receptor 5 (DR5) expressed on the cell
surface. In this study, we elucidated cyclopamine sensitizes to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis by elevating the expression level of DR5 in
gastric cancer cells. Interestingly, survivin hampers existence of DR5
protein under normal condition. Cyclopamine decreases expression level of
survivin. It is a reason for cyclopamine to act as a TRAIL sensitizer.
Mechanistically, cyclopamine induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by
Reactive Oxygen species (ROS), and CHOP, which as a last protein of ER
stress pathway regulates stability of survivin protein by proteasome
degradation. Taken together, our results indicate that cyclopamine can be
used for the purpose of combination therapy in TRAIL-resistant gastric
cancer cells.
