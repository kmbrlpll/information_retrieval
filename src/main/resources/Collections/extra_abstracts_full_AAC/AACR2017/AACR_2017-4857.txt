Title: TAK1 mediated IL1 expression as autocrine signaling to promote
breast cancer metastasis.


TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a serine/threonine kinase from the
MAPKKK family, is regulated by different cytokines such as IL1, TGFβ,
TNFα and BMPs, and it is therefore a key player in the cellular
responses induced by changes in the microenvironment. TAK1 regulates cell
survival, differentiation and inflammatory responses by activating other
intracellular kinases such as p38, JNK or IKK. TAK1 activation is thought
to influence the progression of several types of cancer, including
lymphomas and pancreatic, colon, liver and breast cancer. In this study,
we aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which TAK1 regulates breast
cancer progression. (5Z)-7-Oxozeanol is a compound that inhibits the
kinase activity of TAK1. Treatment of mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells
with (5Z)-7-Oxozeanol containing nanoparticles reduced metastasis
formation, while growth of the primary tumor was not affected. TAK1
involvement in metastasis was confirmed by xenotransplantation
experiments done with MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing wild type or
dominant negative forms of TAK1. Using these stable cell lines, we
confirmed that TAK1 is required for p38 activation induced by several
cytokines. Interestingly, cells cocultured with macrophages showed a
TAK1-dependent increase in the expression levels of IL1α and IL1β,
which can lead to TAK1 activation themselves. These cytokines were also
detected in cancer cells that colonized the mouse lung, suggesting that
the lung microenvironment could promote the initiation of a positive
feedback loop by cancer cells, promoting the growth of metastatic
lesions. Disruption of this positive autocrine feedback loop may be a
potential therapeutic approach to suppress breast cancer metastasis to
the lung.
