Title: Genetic profiling of colitis-associated cancer indicates de novo
carcinogenesis and the impact of chronic inflammation.


Background: Chronic inflammation is one of the major causes of
carcinogenesis. Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD)
increase the risk of colitis-associated cancer (CAC) development, and its
biological and pathological characters are also distinct. However, the
genetic mechanism of how chronic inflammation leads to CACs is still
unclear.

Methods: We obtained frozen tumor tissues from 21 CAC patients and
performed exome or whole-genome sequencing of the matched tumor-normal
samples. We enumerated recurrently mutated genes and selected 43 genes
among them for target capture. We then performed targeted resequencing of
84 FFPE specimens from CAC tissues. Totally, we made genomic profiles of
105 CACs.

Results: The most frequently mutated gene was TP53, whose mutation was
found in 70 of 105 samples (67%), which is more prevalent in CACs than
common colorectal cancers (CRCs). Somatic mutations of APC and KRAS were
less prevalent (17 and 13 samples, respectively). Genes in the Wnt
signaling pathway (APC, FBXW7, TCF7L2, and RNF43) were mutated in 31
samples, whereas those in the TGFβ pathway (TGFBR2, ACVR1B, SMAD2,
SMAD4, LTBP4) were mutated in 25 samples. Mutational signature of CACs
shows some differences from common CRCs.

Conclusion: Our results confirmed genetic differences for cancer
development between CACs and common CRCs. Frequent TP53 mutations and
less frequent APC mutations are consistent with the idea of “de novo”
carcinogenesis than adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The association between
the mutations and clinical information are also discussed.
