Title: The p53 suppression on tumor cells may recruit macrophages and
modulate their expression of the indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase.


We had found that expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) on
cervical cancer cells increased as it progressed from carcinoma in situ
(CIS) to microinvasive cancer, and that tumor-associated macrophages
(TAM) recruited at the invasive front also expressed IDO in cervical
cancer patients (Cancer Sci 98:874-881 2007). We previously produced
homozygous αT3 transgenic mice carrying two copies of αA-SV40Tag
transgene (αA denotes murine αA-crystallin promoter) in order to study
DNA virus-induced carcinogenesis. The αT3 mice developed
undifferentiated cancer of lens epithelium, which tumors showed
multi-step carcinogenesis which was similar to cervical cancer (J Cancer
Res Clin Oncol 135:1521-1532 2009). We found that homozygous αT3 mice
carrying two copies of SV40Tag transgene progressed faster and died
earlier than hemizygous αT3 mice carrying one copy of Tag transgene. In
this study, in order to examine the relationship between p53 function and
tumor progression, αT3 mice were mated with M1 mice expressing mutant
p53 in lens cells (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 92:6142-6146, 1995)
producing αT3M1 mice, and also were mated with p53-deficient mice to
produce p53-deficient αT3 (αT3p53(-/-)) mice( Cancer Letters
179:165-173,2002, Oncology Report 12:253-258, 2004). At 20 weeks of age,
the proportion of progression from CIS to invasive cancer was analyzed by
H&E staining and the number of recruited TAM and IDO-expressing TAM were
determined by immunohistochemical staining and FACS analysis.
Pathologically, both αT3M1 and αT3p53(-/-) lens tumors significantly
progressed to invasive cancer more than αT3 tumors. There were a few
macrophages in wild-type lens, but more TAM were recruited in both αT3,
αT3M1 and αT3p53(-/-) lens tumors. However, no significant difference
of the number of IDO-expressing macrophages in peritoneal cavity was
detected in each mice of wild-type, αT3, αT3M1 and αT3p53(-/-). It
suggested that p53 suppression on tumor cells might modulate
IDO-expression for macrophages. Moreover, we established the tumor cell
lines from each αT3, αT3M1 and αT3p53(-/-) lens tumors. The peritoneal
macrophages were analyzed for IDO-expression in 4 days after i.p.
injection of these cells. Significantly, IDO-expressing macrophages in
peritoneal cavity were more detected after i.p. injection of each αT3M1
and αT3p53(-/-) cells than i.p. injection of αT3 cells. And the
co-culture of peritoneal macrophages with each αT3M1 and αT3p53(-/-)
tumor cells also induced the IDO-expression of macrophages more than the
co-culture with αT3 cells. These results suggested that the amount of
p53 suppression on tumor cells would be related to the number of
recruited TAM and their expression of IDO. The p53 suppression on tumor
cells may recruit TAM and affect the macrophage function and, suppress an
innate immunity possibly through the expression of IDO, which may enhance
invasion and progression of tumors.
