Title: PGAM1-REDD1 pathway promotes paclitaxel resistance through
enhancing aerobic glycolysis in ovarian cancer cells.


Aerobic glycolysis is a dominant pathway for energy production in cancer
cells, but the association of this phenomenon with chemoresistance
remains still uncertain. Here, we found that the expression of
phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), a key catalytic enzyme in aerobic
glycolysis, was significantly higher in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian
cancer cell line SKOV3. Up-regulated PGAM1 expression by gene
transfection and down-regulated PGAM1 expression by siRNA knockdown
altered the process of aerobic glycolysis, paclitaxel sensitivity and DNA
damage response 1 (REDD1) expression in ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3 and
A2780). Further, the change of the concentration of pyruvic acid or
lactic acid in culture medium and REDD1 expression by gene transfection
or siRNA knockdown also altered the sensitivity to paclitaxel. REDD1
knockdown of by siRNA reversed partially paclitaxel resistance induced by
PGAM1 over-expression in cancer cells, vice versa. Structural interaction
between PGAM1 and REDD1 was predicted by molecular docking. Our results
suggested that PGAM1-REDD1 pathway promotes paclitaxel resistance through
enhancing aerobic glycolysis in ovarian cancer cells.
