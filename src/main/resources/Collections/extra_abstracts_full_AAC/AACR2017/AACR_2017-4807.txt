Title: Braf mutations initiate the development of rat gliomas induced by
postnatal exposure to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU).


Purpose

A single dose of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) during late prenatal or
early postnatal development induces a high incidence of malignant
schwannomas and gliomas in rats. Although T -> A mutations in the
transmembrane domain of the neu (c-ErbB-2) gene are the driver mutations
in ENU-induced malignant schwannomas, the molecular basis of ENU-induced
gliomas was unknown. The objectives of this study were to identify driver
mutations in ENU-induced rat gliomas.

Methods

We performed whole-genome sequencing of gliomas that developed in three
BDIV and two BDIX rats exposed to a single dose of 80 mg ENU/kg body
weight on postnatal day one.

Results

T:A->A:T and T:A->C:G mutations, which are typical for ENU-induced
mutagenesis, were predominant (41-55% of all somatic single nucleotide
mutations). T->A mutations were detected in all 5 rat gliomas at Braf
codon 545 (V545E), which corresponds to the human BRAF V600E. Additional
screening revealed that 33 gliomas in BDIV rats and 12 gliomas in BDIX
rats all carried a Braf V545E mutation, while peritumoral brain tissue of
either strain (n=16) had the wild-type sequence. The gliomas were
immunoreactive to BRAF V600E antibody.

Conclusions

Braf mutation is a frequent early event in the development of rat gliomas
caused by a single dose of ENU.
