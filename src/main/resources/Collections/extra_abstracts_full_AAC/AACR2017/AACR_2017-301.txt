Title: Prognostic value of metastatic tumoral caveolin-1 expression in
patients with resected gastric cancer.


Background : Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), as the main component of caveolae, has
complex roles in tumourigenesis and clinical outcomes in a variety of
human malignancies. We investigated Cav-1 in primary and metastatic tumor
of gastric cancer (GC) and its association with clinical outcomes.

Method : All specimens evaluated were obtained from 145 patients with GC
who had undergone curative gastrectomy. The primary outcomes measured
were the expression levels of Cav-1 by immunohistochemistry and its
association with clinicopathologicalparameters and patient survival.

Results : Among the 145 patients, the frequency of high expression of
stromal Cav-1 within primary tumor and tumoral Cav-1 protein in
metastatic lymph node were 22.5% (18/145) and 16.6% (15/91). In the
multivariate analysis tumoral Cav-1 protein in metastatic lymph node
showed prognostic significance for relapse-free survival (RFS, HR, 3.934;
95% CI, 1.882-8.224; P<0.001) and cancer-specific survival outcome (CSS,
HR, 3.985; 95% CI, 1.620 - 8.623; P = 0.002). In addition, it remained as
a strong indicator of poor prognosis for RFS (HR, 3.137; 95% CI, 1.445 -
6.810; P = 0.004) and CSS (HR, 2.509; 95% CI, 1.079 - 5.838; P = 0.033).

Conclusions : High expression of tumoral Cav-1 protein in metastatic
lymph node shows a strong negative association with the clinical outcomes
in patients with curatively resected GC, suggesting that this protein
have potential uses as novel prognostic markers.
