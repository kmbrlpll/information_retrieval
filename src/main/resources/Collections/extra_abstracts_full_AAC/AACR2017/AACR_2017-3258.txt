Title: Genomic analyses define molecular subtype of lung squamous cell
carcinoma.


Lung squamous cell carcinoma, which account for 25 percent of all lung
cancers, have not been well characterized owing to a lack of systematic
understanding of molecular pathogenesis. We performed the whole-exome and
transcriptome sequencing from 101 tumors and matched normal samples from
Korean patients. Somatic mutations and gene expression defined two
intrinsic subtypes: (1) classical subtype; (2) immunogenic subtype.
Classical subtype displayed upregulation of cell cycle related genes and
enriched for gene mutations (TP53, NAV3, NFE2L2, CDKN2A, PIK2CA, KEAP1
and RB1) involved in cell proliferation, squamous differentiation and
oxidative stress. Immunogenic subtype had more tumor-infiltrating immune
cells than classical type. More proportion of adaptive immune cells was
also detected in immunogenic subtype. Immune genes, involved in adaptive
immune response, were also upregulated in immunogenic subtype. Taken
together, our finding revealed that each subtype has different immune
mechanisms in lung squamous cell carcinoma and provides potential
opportunities for therapeutic development.
