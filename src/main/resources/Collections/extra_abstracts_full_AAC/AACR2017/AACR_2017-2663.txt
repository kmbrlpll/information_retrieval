Title: Characterization of the pharmacodynamic immune response to a novel
immunotherapeutic agent, ALKS 4230, in mice and non-human primates.


ALKS 4230 is a selective agonist of the intermediate-affinity IL-2
receptor (IL-2R). A phase 1 study is ongoing to evaluate the safety and
tolerability of ALKS 4230 in the treatment of patients with refractory
solid tumors. The selectivity of ALKS 4230 is achieved through the stable
fusion of circularly permuted IL-2 to the extracellular portion of the
IL-2Rα chain, CD25. The resulting fusion protein is sterically prevented
from binding to the high-affinity IL-2R complex, comprised of IL-2Rα,
IL-2Rβ, and common gamma chain, expressed preferentially on CD4+ FOXP3+
regulatory T cells (CD4+ Tregs) yet retains full ability to signal
through the intermediate-affinity IL-2R complex, comprised of IL-2Rβ and
common gamma chain, expressed on memory CD8+ T cells and NK cells.
Repeated dosing of ALKS 4230 drives the significant expansion of various
CD8+ T cell and NK cell populations without activation and minimal
expansion of CD4+ Tregs in mice and non-human primates (NHP). The
kinetics of the immunological responses in mice and NHP demonstrate that
the pharmacodynamic effects persist beyond systemic exposure of ALKS
4230. Data demonstrating the effects of ALKS 4230 on tumor-infiltrating
lymphocyte populations in syngeneic tumor models will also be presented.
