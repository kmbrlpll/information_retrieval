Title: Diagnostic leukapheresis results in a significant increase in CTC
yield in metastatic breast and prostate cancer.


Introduction Frequently the number of CTC isolated in 7.5 mL of blood is
too small to reliably determine tumor heterogeneity and to be
representative as a ‘liquid biopsy’. In the EU FP7 program CTCTrap we
aimed to validate and optimize the recently introduced Diagnostic
LeukApheresis (DLA; doi: 10.1073/pnas.1313594110) approach to screen
liters of blood and thereby substantially increasing the number of CTC
available for further characterization. Here we present the results
obtained from 32 metastatic cancer patients subjected to DLA in the
participating institutions.

Methods Before the DLA procedure, whole blood was drawn in a CellSave
blood collection tube and a 7.5 ml aliquot was processed with the ‘gold
standard’ reference CellSearch® (Janssen Diagnostics, USA). DLAs from
metastatic cancer patients were performed for ≈90 minutes to obtain 40
mL of product containing ≈4x109 mononuclear cells (MNC) representing
≈1 liter of blood. The obtained DLA samples were then divided, fixed
with CellSave preservative, prepared and processed with each of the
analysis techniques as described in the Standard Operating Procedures
developed for DLA in the CTCTrap consortium
(https://www.utwente.nl/tnw/mcbp/protocolsandtools/).

Results DLAs were obtained from 20 metastatic prostate cancer patients
and 12 metastatic breast cancer patients at four different European
academic medical institutions. Using a SOP for the DLA procedure, similar
DLA products (MNC concentration: 64x106/mL, SD = 38x106) could be
generated without any noticeable side effects. CTC in 7.5 mL of blood
ranged from 0 to 324 (mean = 61, median = 18). DLA processed with
CellSearch represented 7 to 212 mL of blood (mean = 100, median = 97),
CTC ranged from 0 to 2913 (mean = 330, median = 105). Resulting in a
significant increase in CTC yield (p = 0.004) ranging from 0x to 40x
(mean = 13, median = 9) when comparing 1mL of whole blood to 1mL of DLA.
Filtration of 50x106 WBC of DLA, through 5um microsieves yielded only 0
to 12 CTC (mean = 2, median = 0, n = 16). Leukocyte depletion of 18 mL of
DLA followed by filtration yielded 0 to 178 CTC (mean = 37, median = 4, n
= 22) not yielding a relative increase versus CellSearch DLA. Leukocyte
depletion followed by CellSearch yielded 271 to 1620 CTC (mean = 792,
median = 484, n = 3) also not yielding a relative increase versus
CellSearch DLA. In 7 patients 0 CTC were detected in 7.5mL of blood, in 4
out of these 7 patients CTC were detected in DLA.

Conclusion The yield of CTC can be significantly increased by the use of
DLA in patients with CTC detected in 7.5 mL of blood. Technology to
select CTC from DLAs will need to be further improved before one can make
optimal use of the large processed blood volumes.
