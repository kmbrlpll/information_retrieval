Title: Poly G oligonucleotide enhances anti-tumor immune response among
the patients with primary lung cancer.


Synthetic oligonucleotides (ODNs) containing specific sequences have an
immunomodulatory effect. It is highly expected that such ODNs can be
developed into a novel anti-cancer immunotherapy with these effects. Our
past data revealed that a novel poly-G ODN has an anti-tumor immune
effect in the tumor-bearing murine model. This effect of poly-G ODN was
mediated by T cells in a TLR9 independent manner. Poly-G ODN directly
induced the phosphorylation of Lck, thereby enhancing the production of
IL-2 and T cell proliferation. Meanwhile, our recent data suggested that
the immune effect by poly-G ODN against cancer was different in human. We
identified poly-G ODN induced T cell proliferation and production of
IFN-gamma through the enhancement of monocyte maturation in human
mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood or malignant pleural
effusion of lung cancer patients. Further studies are continued for the
establishment of a novel anti-cancer immune therapy with poly-G ODN.
