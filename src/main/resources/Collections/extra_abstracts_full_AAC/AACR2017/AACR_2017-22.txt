Title: MM-161, a first-in-class pan-FGFR antibody.


Aberrant signaling of the FGFR pathway has long been known to promote
tumorigenesis and angiogenesis across multiple cancer indications.
However, the development of an effective and well-tolerated FGFR targeted
inhibitor has been hindered by the need to block the activation of
multiple mitogenic receptors while avoiding significant toxicities
associated with blocking endocrine FGF ligands.

Here we disclose for the first time a novel FGFR targeted antibody,
MM-161, designed to block ligand-dependent signaling driven by all four
FGF receptors, specifically the IIIc-isoforms. MM-161 is well tolerated
in mice and cynomolgus monkeys with no significant weight loss observed
in either species. Efficacy studies demonstrated that MM-161 monotherapy
leads to significant tumor growth inhibition or tumor regression of
xenografts of human lung, renal and endometrial cancer amongst others.
Importantly, MM-161 has a dual mechanism of action by inhibiting both
proliferation and angiogenesis. We will present data illustrating that
inhibition of multiple FGFRs is desirable to achieve tumor regression.
Furthermore, we will show combination studies with relevant standard of
care therapies in models of lung and renal cancer.

Taken together, our preclinical data strongly supports the clinical
evaluation of MM-161 in cancer patients.
