Title: ETV6 is a tumor suppressor regulated by EGFR-miR-96 pathway in
prostate cancer.


ETV6 is an ETS transcription factor and a putative tumor suppressor in
prostate cancer according to several genomic analyses. However, its
cellular functions and upstream regulating signaling remain unclear. We
demonstrated that ETV6 suppresses the prostate cancer progression and
that ETV6 levels are negatively associated with advanced prostate cancer,
supporting the idea that ETV6 acts as a tumor suppressor. Furthermore,
ETV6 can be regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
signaling through microRNA (miR)-mediated downregulation. One of the
miRs, miR-96, can be transcriptionally-regulated by nuclear EGFR. The
association patterns connecting miR-96, EGFR activation, and ETV6 were
further validated in the clinical tissue samples. We proposed an
EGFR-miR-96-ETV6 signaling pathway in promoting prostate cancer.
