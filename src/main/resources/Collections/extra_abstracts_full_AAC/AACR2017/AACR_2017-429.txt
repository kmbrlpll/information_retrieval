Title: Integrated genomic DNA and RNA profiling to predict cancer
immunotherapy response.


Immunotherapy response varies widely, making it difficult for physicians
to know whether immunotherapy will be effective for a given patient.
Recent studies have reported that patients with high PD-L1 gene
expression are likely to respond to checkpoint blocking drugs, but there
are still many patients whose tumor test for the PD-L1 protein are
negative and can respond to the drugs. In addition to the potential link
between mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations and clinical response to
anti-PD1 immunotherapy drug, recent findings show that tumor mutation
burden and microsatellite instable (MSI) are good indicators of the
cancer immunotherapy responses. Using Predicineâ€™s proprietary Gene
RADAR (RNA and DNA single molecular digital Readings) technology, here we
report the development of PrediSeq-CI (Cancer Immunotherapy) panel for
comprehensive genomic profiling of DNA and RNA that are associated with
cancer immunotherapy response. The panel has been tested using both
tissue biopsy and plasma samples. The development of PrediSeq-CI test has
potential to enable precision medicine in cancer immunotherapy. Finally,
we also developed a liquid biopsy droplet digital PCR test to measure
PD-L1 expression in blood.
