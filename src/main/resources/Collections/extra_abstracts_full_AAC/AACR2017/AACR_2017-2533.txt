Title: Sox2 promotes cell proliferation of esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma through the miR-17-92 cluster ,PTEN,AKT,mTORC1 pathway.


SOX2, a member of the SOX family of transcription factors, play an
important role of differentiation and morphogenesis of the esophagus. We
previously revealed that SOX2 is the target of gene amplification at 3q26
in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (Cancer Genet Cytogenet.
2010), and that SOX2 promotes ESCC cell proliferation in vitro and in
vivo through the activation of the AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway (Cancer
Sci. 2013). However, the mechanisms by which SOX2 promotes AKT/mTORC1
signaling remain unknown. It is known that PTEN is a negative regulator
of AKT and the PTEN gene is a target of the miR-17-92 cluster. In the
present study, we showed that SOX2 up-regulated the expression of
miR-17-92 cluster and repressed PTEN expression using RNA interference
(RNAi)-mediated knockdown of SOX2 and enforced expression of SOX2. In
summary, SOX2 promotes cell proliferation of ESCC through the miR-17-92
cluster /PTEN/AKT/mTORC1 pathway.
