Title: Elevated level of serum miR-99a is correlated with serous
epithelial ovarian cancer and can be a potential biomarker.


Objective: There is a critical need for improved diagnostic markers to
detect ovarian high grade serous cancer (HGSC). microRNAs (miRNAs) stably
exist in circulating blood, reflecting tissue or organ conditions and
present in circulating microvesicles such as exosomes. We aimed to
identify which miRNAs are highly produced from HGSCs and analyze whether
serum miRNA can discriminate patients with HGSC from healthy controls.

Methods: Secreted exosomes from ovarian cancer cell lines were collected
and exosomal miRNAs extracted. miRNA microarray was performed and several
elevated miRNAs specific to ovarian cancer cells were picked up. Among
these, we focused on miR-99a. Sera were collected from 15 patients with
HGSC (stage III and IV) and 10 healthy controls. Expression level of
miR-99a was determined by miRNA RT-qPCR.

Results: miRNA microarray revealed several miRNAs were highly expressed
in exosomes in patients with HGSC. In patients, serum miR-99a levels were
significantly increased (4.8 fold) compared with those of healthy
controls. ROC analysis showed that at the cut-off of 1.4, the sensitivity
and specificity were 73 % and 80 % respectively for detecting HGSC (AUC =
0.85).

Conclusion: Exosomal miRNAs can be detected in sera of patients with HGSC
and have the potential to predict ovarian cancer.
