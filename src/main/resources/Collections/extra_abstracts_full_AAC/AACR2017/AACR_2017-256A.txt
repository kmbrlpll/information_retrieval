Title: Validation of methyl donors between two food measurements in a
colorectal cancer study.


Purpose: The purpose of this study was to validate methyl donor intakes
between 30-day food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and 24-hour food record
(FR) in a colorectal cancer study.

Background: Dietary methyl donors play pivotal roles in cancer prevention
by promoting adequate metabolism and DNA methylation. The FFQ and 24-hour
FR are the most commonly used methods to assess adequate nutrient intake,
including methyl donors and other vital micronutrients that are essential
to promote metabolism and methylation. While FFQ provides best estimates
in dietary intakes, a 24-hour food record is less time consuming for
subject burden.

Methods: A total of 134 participants’ dietary data were collected using
FFQ and 24-hour FR by using US Department of Agriculture computerized
programs. Bland and Altman methodology was used to validate the bias and
agreement between these two measurements.

Results: Overall, the 24-hour measurements presented underestimated
values across all nutrients in comparison to FFQ measurements. Using a
10% criterion on the differences between the two measurements, the
percentage bias for 24-hour FR compared to 30-day FFQ was acceptable for
most B vitamins, including B1 (-6.9 ±0.15), B2 (-8.66± 0.12), B3
(-9.25± 0.12), B6 (-5.02, ± 0.14), and B9 (folate: -7.90 ±0.24).
However, the bias was greater for protein based methyl donors, including
B12 (-17.23± 0.14), choline (-13.38± 0.11), Glycine (-17.53± 0.10),
and Methionine (-18.88± 0.09). The correlations between the two
measurements on all methyl donors ranged from 0.92 to 0.99. The
precisions for all measurements based on the standard error (SE) were
less than and within 0.03% (0.007 -0.021%). And, the agreements between
the two measurements were less than and within 10% for Glycine and
methionine (8.96 - 9.58%), based on the standard deviation (SD); however,
greater than 10% for other protein based methyl donors including choline
and other B vitamins (10.5-24.11%).

Conclusion: Proper dietary intakes of methyl donors are vital for cancer
prevention. These findings point out the importance of further validation
and use of more accurate food measurement to monitor dietary intake, and
the interpretation of nutrient reports with caution.
