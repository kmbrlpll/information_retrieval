Title: LTB and LTBR mediates alternative Nf-kB activation through NIk and
RELB/NF-kB2 to promote cell migration of HNSCC.


Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) includes a family of NF-κB/REL transcription
factors that regulate key inflammatory and cancer genes, and which are
aberrantly activated in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC).
Lymphotoxin beta/Lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβ/LTβR) can mediate
activation of the “alternative” NF-κB pathway that includes
NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), Inhibitor-κB kinase α (IKKα), and
transcription factors RELB/NF-κB2. While LTβ is expressed in lymph
nodes where HNSCC spread, the role of this pathway in pathogenesis of
HNSCC is not well studied. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
data reveals that LTβR is amplified or overexpressed in larynx or oral
cavity HNSCC, while LTα/β, NIK, (MAP3K14) and RELB are overexpressed in
oropharynx and tonsil cancers. Similarly, we observed overexpression of
LTβR, NIK, and RELB proteins in subsets of HNSCC cell lines. In
UM-SCC46, LTβ enhanced nuclear translocation of RELB/NF-κB2 (p52)
subunit proteins, while LTβR siRNA knockdown decreased the expression of
its target kinase NIK and RELB/NF-κB2 (p52). NIK knockdown also
decreased RELB/NF-κB2 (p52) protein expression, whereas LTβ treatment
stabilized NIK, and RELB/NF-κB2 (p52). Functional LTβ-mediated NF-κB
activation was examined using a stably transfected NF-κB reporter cell
line for β-lactamase/Fret activity. Knockdown of LTβR and NIK decreased
NF-κB activity, whereas treatment with LTβ partially restored it.
Treatment with a NIK inhibitor (1, 3[2H, 4H]-Iso-Quinoline Dione) reduced
the protein expression of NIK, IKKα, and RELB/NF-κB2 (p52) in the
cytoplasm and/or in the nucleus, and blocked LTβ induced translocation
of RELB to nucleus. NIK and RELB knockdown by siRNA or using NIK
inhibitor slowed HNSCC migration. Knockdown of NIK inhibited the
LTβ-induced expression of MET, and SERPINE1 genes involved in migration,
and knockdown of MET by siRNA inhibited the migration of HNSCC cell
lines. Our findings show that LTβ/LTβ receptor promotes activation of
the alternative NIK-IKKa-RELB/NF-κB2 pathway, to enhance MET-mediated
cell migration in HNSCC. This may help explain why HNSCC exhibit
migration and metastasis to local lymph nodes, where LTβ is expressed.
The constitutive and LTβ induced activation of NIK and downstream NF-κB
alternate pathway proteins, RELB and NF-κB2/p52 could be therapeutic
targets in HNSCC.
