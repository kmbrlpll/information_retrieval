Title: Comparison of technologies for EGFR analysis within a subset of a
randomized clinical trial.


Background: EGFR mutation analysis is laborious often requiring >5
working days and multiple slices of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue. Idylla™ is a fully integrated, automated molecular
diagnostics platform combining speed, ease of use, high sensitivity,
multiplexing capabilities, offering sensitive detection of 52 mutations
including insertions and deletions in exons 18-21.

Methods: We assessed 149 cases from the phase III TAILOR study (Garassino
et al, Lancet Oncology 2013;14:981-8), where EGFR was centrally assessed.
Relative concordance between study entry classification to TAILOR (Sanger
sequencing), Idylla™ and next generation sequencing (NGS) for EGFR were
investigated. Single unprocessed sections were used per Idylla™ and NGS
following pathological review. NGS was performed using the AmpliseqTM
Colon and Lung Cancer Panel v2 on an Ion Torrent PGM™ (Thermo Fisher)
in a reference laboratory3; Idylla™ (Biocartis NV) was performed at
Biocartis1. Samples and study genotypes were blinded to NGS and Idylla™.

Results: There were 132 eligible calls to compare NGS vs Idylla™ (14
fails NGS, 1 Idylla™, 2 both); 108 to compare Sanger vs Idylla™ (38
fails Sanger, 2 Idylla™, 1 both); 101 to compare Sanger vs NGS (31
fails Sanger, 7 NGS, 9 both). For NGS, a minimum coverage of 500 reads
was set at a clinically relevant LOD of 5% mutant allelic frequency for
calls. Comparison NGS vs Idylla™: 46 EGFR (34.8%) mutation positive by
Idylla™, 43 (32.6%) by NGS; Sensitivity 93.48%; Specificity 100.00 %.
Comparison Sanger v Idylla™: 41 EGFR (38.0%) mutation positive by
Idylla™, 38 (35.2%) by Sanger; Sensitivity 85.37%; Specificity 95.52 %.
Sanger v NGS: 39 EGFR (38.6%) mutation positive by NGS, 39 (38.6%) by
Sanger; Sensitivity 87.18%; Specificity 91.94 %. Of 16 NGS failures 14
were reportable by Idylla™.

Conclusions: Idylla™ proved to be a reliable platform for rapid EGFR
mutational status evaluation. Compared to NGS and Sanger sequencing
Idylla™ has several advantages: its ease of use, hands on time
Conclusions: Idylla™ proved to be a reliable platform for rapid EGFR
mutational status evaluation. Compared to NGS and Sanger sequencing
Idylla™ has several advantages: its ease of use, hands on time <5 mins,
all-inclusive lyophilized cartridge requiring only one section of 5μm
FFPE, restricted secondary manipulation errors in a busy workflow.
Positive and Negative predictive values for both Idylla™ and NGS were
excellent. Although NGS offers significant additional clinical data
availability through multiplexing, the number of samples classified as
inadequate for NGS (14/16 giving result with Idylla™) indicates a
likely requirement of more sample robust platforms in diagnostic
workflows.
