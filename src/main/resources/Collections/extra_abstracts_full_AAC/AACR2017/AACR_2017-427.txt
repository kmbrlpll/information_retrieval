Title: A path towards determining tumor mutation burden and identifying
neoantigens using next-generation sequencing (NGS).


Introduction: The recent clinical demonstrations that cancer
immunotherapy is effective for some patients, but not others has led to
widespread interest in identifying cancer genetic factors that can
predict positive response. Importantly, it has been shown by various
studies that tumor mutation burden (TMB) and predicted neoantigen load
correlate with patient response to checkpoint inhibitors. This project
aims to develop a clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay that
utilizes TMB and neoantigen information to guide cancer immunotherapy
selection.

Experimental Procedures: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole
transcriptome sequencing (WTS) libraries were generated using
Illumina’s TruSeq® Exome and RNA Access library preparation kits,
respectively. The samples were pair-end sequenced (2x75bp) using HiSeq®
2000 and 2500 instruments.

Data Summary: Here, we demonstrate a workflow using tumor/normal WES and
tumor-only WTS to determine expressed TMB. Using the WES data, we were
also able to accurately identify human leukocyte antigen (HLA) major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I genes at four-digit resolution.
We then identified putative neoantigens, defined as peptides with mutated
amino acids, that were expressed in the tumor samples and predicted to
bind to the respective HLA sequences. In addition, as a path towards
developing a clinical assay for TMB and neoantigen determination, we
tested the ability of reagents developed for Illumina’s Trusight®
Tumor 170 panel to be used for an exome panel. With workflow
modifications, we achieved comparable quality of sequencing metrics as
compared to the TruSeq® Exome kit.

Conclusion: Our data demonstrate a path towards developing a clinical
assay that can be used to assess TMB and neoantigen candidates.
