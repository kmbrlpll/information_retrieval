Title: Dynamin 2 mediates PDGFR-SHP-2-promoted glioblastoma growth and
invasion


Dynamin 2 (Dyn2), a large GTPase, is involved in receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK)-promoted cell migration. However, molecular mechanisms by which
Dyn2 regulates RTK-induced cell migration have not been established.
Recently we reported that SHP-2 and PI3K mediate PDGFR[[Unsupported
Character - Symbol Font a]]-promoted glioma tumor growth and invasion.
Here, we show that Dyn2 is an effector downstream of the
PDGFR[[Unsupported Character - Symbol Font a]]-PI3K/SHP-2 signaling in
glioma cells. Depletion of endogenous Dyn2 by shRNAs inhibited
PDGFR[[Unsupported Character - Symbol Font a]]-stimulated phosphorylation
of Akt, Erk1/2, Rac1 and Cdc42 activities, glioma cell migration and
survival in vitro, tumor growth and invasion in the brains of mice. Dyn2
binds to SHP-2, PI3K and co-localizes with PDGFR[[Unsupported Character -
Symbol Font a]] at the invasive fronts in PDGF-A-stimulated glioma cells.
Inhibition of SHP-2 by siRNA knockdown abrogated Dyn2 association with
activated PDGFR[[Unsupported Character - Symbol Font a]] and
PDGFR[[Unsupported Character - Symbol Font a]] activation of Rac1 and
Cdc42, glioma cell migration, thereby establishing a link between SHP-2
interaction with Dyn2 and the PDGFR[[Unsupported Character - Symbol Font
a]] signaling. Furthermore, a dominant negative SHP-2 C459S mutant
inhibited PDGF-A-stimulated glioma cell migration, phosphorylation of
Dyn2 and concomitantly blocked PDGFR[[Unsupported Character - Symbol Font
a]]-induced Src activation. Inhibition of Src by Src inhibitors
attenuated PDGF-A-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and Dyn2 and glioma
cell migration. Additionally, mutations of binding sites to PI3K, SHP-2
or Src of PDGFR[[Unsupported Character - Symbol Font a]] impaired
PDGFR[[Unsupported Character - Symbol Font a]]-stimulated phosphorylation
of Akt and Dyn2, and Dyn2 association with activated PDGFR[[Unsupported
Character - Symbol Font a]]. Taken together, this study identifies Dyn2
as an effector that mediates PDGFR[[Unsupported Character - Symbol Font
a]]-SHP-2-induced glioma tumor growth and invasion, suggesting that
targeting the PDGFR[[Unsupported Character - Symbol Font a]]-SHP-2-Dyn2
pathway may be beneficial to patients with malignant glioblastomas.
