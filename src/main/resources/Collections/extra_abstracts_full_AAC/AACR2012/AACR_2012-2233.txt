Title: IKBKE activates Akt independent of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/PDK1/mTORC2 to sustain malignant transformation


Serine/threonine kinase Akt regulates key cellular processes such as cell
growth, proliferation, and survival. Activation of Akt by mitogenic
factor depends on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Here, we report
that IKBKE activates Akt in response to inflammatory agent but not growth
factor stimuli through a PI3K-independent pathway. Depletion of IKBKE
inhibits basal and inflammatory factor-stimulated Akt activation. IKBKE
directly phosphorylates Akt-Thr308 and -Ser473 independent of
plecstrin-homology (PH) domain. IKBKE activation of Akt was not affected
by inhibition of PI3K, knockdown of PDK1 or mTORC2 complex. Further, this
activation could be inhibited by Akt inhibitors MK-2206 and GSK690693 but
not the compounds (perifosine and triciribine) targeting PH domain of
Akt. Expression of IKBKE largely correlates with activation of Akt in
breast cancer. Moreover, inhibition of Akt suppresses IKBKE oncogenic
transformation. These findings indicate that IKBKE is an Akt-Thr308 and
-Ser473 kinase and directly activates Akt independent of PI3K, PDK1 and
mTORC2. Our data also suggest that Akt inhibitors targeting the PH domain
have no effect on the tumours in which hyperactive Akt is resulted from
elevated IKBKE.
