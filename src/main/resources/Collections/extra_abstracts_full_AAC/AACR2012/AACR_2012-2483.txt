Title: Inhibition of the polycomb group gene EZH2 suppresses growth and
radiosensitizes ATRT cells by promoting senescence and inhibiting the
CycinD-E2F1 axis


Overexpression of the polycomb group gene Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2)
occurs in many tumors including prostate cancer, breast cancer and brain
tumors such as Glioblastoma multiform and Medulloblastoma. Recent
evidence suggests it may also have a role in rhabdoid tumors. Atypical
teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a rare high-grade brain tumor with very
poor survival that occurs most commonly in children. AT/RT tumors are
characterized by deletion of the chromatin associated protein SMARCB1.
Given the role of EZH2 in regulating epigenetic changes we chose to
investigate the role of EZH2 in AT/RT. Here we show that targeted
disruption of EZH2 by RNAi or pharmacologic means strongly impairs ATRT
cell growth, induces apoptosis and potently sensitizes these cells to
radiation. Using functional analysis of transcription factor activity we
found the Cyclin D-E2F1 axis to be repressed upon EZH2 depletion in ATRT
cells. Taken together our observations provide evidence that EZH2
regulates cell cycle progression by targeting the G1-S transition
machinery and may be an important new therapeutic target particularly in
combination with radiation in ATRT.
