Title: Hepatitis B virus X protein induces Src homology 2-containing
protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2, expression through the NF-kB pathway
in HBV-infected hepatocellular carcinomas


Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has a crucial role in the development
of hepatocellular carcinoma and activates many transcription factors,
including AP-1, NF-kB and CREB. In the present study, we showed that
increased SHP2 expression was observed in 16 (53%) of the 30 cases of
HBV-positive hepatocellular carcinomas tissues. We investigated the
relationship of SHP2 and HBx in stably HBx-overexpressing Huh7-X and
transiently HBx expressing HEK293 cells. The level of SHP2 proteins was
concomitantly increased with HBX in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293
cells. We identified a putative NF-kB binding site within 500 bp of the
SHP2 promoter and also observed the decrease of SHP2 proteins after the
treatment of the NF-kB/p65 inhibitor, parthenolide in HBx expressing
cell. In addition, we confirmed that the complex of NF-kB and HBx
proteins direct bound to the SHP2 promoter by chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-real time PCR assays. Taken together, we
conclude that HBV infection induces SHP2 overexpression through the
HBx-NF-kB pathway. Currently, we are investigating the effects of SHP2
overexpression in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
