Title: Evaluation of mutation detection sensitivity in exome sequencing
and other genotyping platforms


An evaluation was performed to compare mutation calls from exome capture
sequencing data to publicly available data sets derived from Sequenom
MassARRAY and Sanger sequencing methods. We compared hot-spots KRAS and
BRAF mutations using Sanger sequencing method in patient-derived tumor
grafts. Mutation data of the tumor grafts were also generated with
Sequenom MassARRAY using the OncoCarta panel. We also evaluated the
sensitivity of mutation detection for a panel of cancer genes in >100
cancer cell lines against the data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
Project (OncoMap mutation panel) as well as the Sanger's Cancer Genome
Project. Overall, we observed high sensitivity and concordance of the
mutation calls from the exome sequencing with the other platforms and
technologies. The above comparisons support the use of exome sequencing
as a sensitive mutation detection method for patient-derived tumor grafts
and cancer cell lines.
