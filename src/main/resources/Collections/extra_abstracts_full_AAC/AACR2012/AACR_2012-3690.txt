Title: 19-nor-1-25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 induces gastric cancer cell
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and inhibits STAT3 mediated inflammation


The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
(calcitriol), inhibits the growth of several types of human cancer cells
in vitro, but its therapeutic use is limited because it causes
hypercalcemia. Among its analogs, 19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 has
fewer calcemic effects and exhibits an activity that is equipotent to
that of calcitriol in several in vivo and in vitro systems. This study
demonstrated that paricalcitol has antitumor activity in gastric cancer
cells. Treatment with paricalcitol inhibited gastric cancer cell growth,
induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and decreased the expression of
cycle-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Additionally, paricalcitol led to
apoptosis via induction of caspase-3 cleavage and decreased expression of
anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL. Inhibition of STAT3, COX-2, and NF-B activities
was also observed. Moreover, growth of peritoneal metastases in vivo was
significantly reduced in mice treated with19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D2. These results suggest that the vitamin D analog
(19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2) has anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory
activity in gastric cancer cells, suggesting that it holds promise as a
novel therapy for the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer.
