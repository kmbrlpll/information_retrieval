Title: Excess c-Myc loads tissue-specific enhancers in tumor cells


Excessive expression of c-Myc occurs frequently in human cancers, where
high levels are associated with tumor aggression and poor clinical
outcome. It is well established that the c-Myc protein forms a
heterodimer with Max, binds to E-box sequences typically located near the
core promoter elements of target genes involved in cellular
proliferation, and alters expression of these genes. It is not yet clear,
however, how altering the levels of c-Myc affects its activity across the
genome to enhance the oncogenic state of cells. We show here that c-Myc
occupies occupies enhancer elements only in tumor cells with elevated
levels of c-Myc. The enhancers that are occupied are often tumor-specific
and associated with the cell-of-origin of the tumor. These and additional
results provide insights into a key mechanism by which c-Myc
overexpression alters the transcriptional state of cancer cells to
enforce their tumorigenic state and malignant potential.
