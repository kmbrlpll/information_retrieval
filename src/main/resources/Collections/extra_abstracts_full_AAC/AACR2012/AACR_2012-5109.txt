Title: Identical cancer cell lines from Sanger & Broad CCLE programs
sometimes differ


The Sanger Institute in the UK has an ongoing initiative termed the
Cancer Genome Project to systematically characterize the genetics and
genomics of 770 cancer cell lines. Similarly, the Broad Institute in the
US collaborates on the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia or CCLE project,
entailing the eventual characterization of approximately 1000 cancer cell
lines. At present, there are over 400 cell lines shared by these two
initiatives. As part of a number of computational efforts in cancer
biology we have used data from these two programs and have observed some
unexpected differences in cell lines at the DNA and/or transcript level
as well as some phenotypic differences, and we present here an analysis
of these results including implications to the use of cancer cell lines
in drug discovery and the larger question of genomic stability in cancer.
