Title: Preclinical systems to study the biodistribution of nanoparticle
delivery in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma


Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a deadly disease, with no
effective available treatment. Primary chemoresistance is common and has
been attributed to the hypovascularity characteristic of the disease and
the dense desmoplastic response that accompanies virtually every case of
PDA. Effectively delivering therapeutic anticancer agents to PDA cells is
therefore a specific, difficult and understudied problem in PDA that must
be resolved for successful treatments to emerge. With the goal of
eventually delivering drug payloads via nanoparticles (NP), we used
well-defined mouse models of the disease to iteratively test NP
distribution to both the cancerous and normal pancreas. Minimal
deposition was observed in normal pancreas after intravenous or
intraperitoneal administration of a variously sized (25nm or 40nm) NP.
Surprisingly, abundant NP deposition was seen in both syngenic
xenografted and autochthonous KPC models of PDA. NP deposition tended to
be greater with IP administration and was enriched in stoma rich tumor
regions. These findings have encouraging ramifications for delivery of
depot or novel (e.g. siRNA, radiopharmaceutical, etc.) agents in this
deadly disease.
