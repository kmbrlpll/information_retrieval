Title: N-cadherin promotes metastasis by enhancing motility through Akt3
suppression


Here we show that in vivo mammary expression of N-cadherin in the PyMT
model which enhances breast tumor metastasis results in selective
inhibition of Akt3 expression and phosphorylation. Similarly, exogenous
expression of N-cadherin in PyMT tumor cells which enhances motility
caused a dramatic reduction in Akt3 expression and activation. Moreover,
knockdown of Akt3 in PyMT cells enhanced cell motility, disrupted mammary
morphogenesis but had no effect on cell proliferation. Conversely,
overexpression of constitutively active Akt3 inhibited cell motility,
suggesting signaling through Akt3 relays motility suppression by
N-cadherin. Taken altogether, these findings demonstrate that N-cadherin
suppresses Akt3 to promote cell motility and highlight the intricate
regulation of the AKT pathway by N-cadherin during metastasis.
