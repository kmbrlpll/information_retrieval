Title: Identification of autocrine motility factor (AMF) receptor, HER2
(ErbB2) in breast cancer cells


Overexpression of HER2 (ErbB2) oncoprotein is associated with
approximately 25% of aggressive breast carcinoma. Although a humanized
monoclonal antibody (Trastuzumab) against HER2 is currently considered
one of the most effective treatments, a significant number of patients
are initially or eventually become resistant to Trastuzumab based
therapy. Here, we demonstrate that secreted phosphoglucose isomerase
(PGI)/ autocrine motility factor (AMF), an orphan -CXXC- cytokine
directly binds to HER2 and activates PI3K and MAPK through HER2
autophosphorylation, and also induces immediately HER2 cleavage in
metalloprotease dependent fashion. We therefore speculate that AMF/HER2
signaling pathways play a physiological role in HER2 overexpressing
breast cancer cells and contribute to Trastuzumab resistance and propose
that AMF can be a novel therapeutic target in Trastuzumab resistant
breast cancer.
