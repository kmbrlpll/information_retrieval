Title: Identification and functional analysis of SHISA2 overexpressed in
prostate cancer


Prostate cancer (PC) is usually androgen-dependent and responds well to
androgen ablation therapy. However, at a certain stage some prostate
cancers eventually acquire a castration-resistant phenotype. These cancer
cells are originally high-grade and show very poor response to any
anticancer therapies. To identify novel molecular cancer drug targets, we
previously analyzed the gene expression profiles of high-grade PCs using
a cDNA microarray combined with laser microbeam microdissection and found
a number of genes that are transactivated in high-grade PC. Among them,
we report the identification of a novel molecular target, SHISA2. We
confirmed overexpression of SHISA2 in high-grade prostate cancer cells by
semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. Knockdown of
SHISA2 expression by siRNA in a prostate cancer cell line resulted in a
drastic decrease of cell numbers. In contrast, SHISA2 overexpression in a
prostate cancer cell line promoted cell proliferation. These findings
suggest that SHISA2 could be involved in aggressive phenotype of prostate
cancers, including castration-resistant prostate cancers, and that it
should be a potential molecular target for development of new
therapeutics and a diagnostic biomarker for aggressive prostate cancers.
