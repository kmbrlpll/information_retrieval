Title: High throughput homogenous bioluminescent assays for monitoring
the concentrations of AMP, ADP and ATP


Adenine nucleotides are major determinants of the energy status of the
cell and thus any modulation of their cellular concentration has
significant consequences to cellular metabolism, cellular growth and cell
death. ATP generating enzymes are usually involved in anabolic processes
while ATP consuming enzymes are involved in catabolite processes. We have
developed biochemical assays that monitor the concentrations of ATP, ADP
and AMP in a biochemical reaction. For instance ATP depletion dependent
assays and ADP generating assays monitor the activity of kinases and
ATPases. These universal assays can measure the activity of various
enzymes with no modification of the native substrate and the ability to
use diverse substrates such as proteins, peptides, lipids, sugars, etc.
The AMP generating reactions such as ubiquitin ligases, aa aminoacyl
t-RNA synthetases, DNA ligases, cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterases, etc.
can be also monitored with high sensitivity and reproducibility. We will
show data using these various technologies in monitoring the various
adenine nucleotide concentrations in biochemical reactions.
