Title: An attempt to replicate the results of genome-wide association
studies on lung cancer susceptibility loci in a Korean population


Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified three chromosomal
regions at 5p15, 6p21, and 15q25 as being associated with lung cancer
risk in European populations. This study was performed to confirm these
associations in Korean patients with lung cancer. The genotypes of
rs2736100, rs402710, rs401681, and rs31489 at 5p15, rs9295740 at 6p22,
and rs2036534 and rs6495309 at 15q25 were determined in 1094 lung cancer
patients and 1100 healthy controls frequency-matched for age and gender.
The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 5p15 and 15q25 were
significantly associated with lung cancer risk. The magnitude of effect
was similar to that reported in previous studies and the association was
in the same direction. The effect of SNPs at 5p15 region on the risk of
lung cancer was significant only in adenocarcinoma. The two SNPs at 15q25
region were significantly associated with lung cancer risk in
ever-smokers and squamous cell carcinoma. However, there was no
association between the SNP at 6p22 and lung cancer risk. We confirmed
the association between SNPs at the 5p15 and 15q25 regions and the risk
of lung cancer in a Korean population.
