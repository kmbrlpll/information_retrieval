Title: Carbamylated albumin increase MMP9 activity via ERK MAPK pathway


Objective: Carbamylation, the binding of cyanate to amino acid lysine
residues, is a post-translational modification. Pathophysiological
consequences of carbamylation and adverse effects of carbamylated
proteins remain poorly understood. This study was designed to influence
of carbamylated albumin on matrix metalloproteinase(MMP) expressions in
rat mesangial cells (RMC). Methods and Results: The effect of
carbamylated albumin was evaluated using zymography, Western blot
analysis, MMP-9 promoter luciferase assay, and ELISA. We found that
carbamylated albumin significantly increased MMP-9 productions in RMCs
via stimulating MMP-9 promoter activity and ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation.
DecreasedTIMP-1 activity by carbamylated albumin was not observed.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that carbamylated albumin increased MMP-9
activity via ERK1/2MAPK mediated pathway and further studies as to the
functions of carbamylated albumin will be of merit.
