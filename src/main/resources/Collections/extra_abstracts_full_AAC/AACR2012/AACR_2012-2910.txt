Title: Selenium nanoparticles suppress prostate LNCaP cancer cells growth
through induced endogenous apoptosis


Prostate cancer has the highest incidence in all kinds of cancers in
males.Recent reports suggest androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role
in prostate cancer development.The trace element Selenium is suggested
having cancer prevention activity and used as food supplement. Here, we
investigated inherent anticancer mechanisms of Selenium nanoparticles. We
found Selenium nanoparticles inhibit growth of prostate LNCaP cancer
cells partially through caspases mediated apoptosis. Selenium
nanoparticles suppress transcriptional activity of androgen receptor via
down-regulating its mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, Selenium
nanoparticles activate Akt kinase by increasing its phosphorylation,
promote Akt-dependent androgen receptor phosphorylation and Mdm2
regulated degradation through proteasome pathway. Together, we suggest
Selenium nanoparticles suppress prostate cancer cells growth by
disrupting androgen receptor, implicating a potential application in
cancer treatment.
