Title: Synthesis and structure activity relationship of substituted
N,6-diphenyl-5,6-dihydrobenzo[h]quinazolin-2-amine as inhibitors of
fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR)


Utilization of hydrophobic motifs present in auto-inhibited protein
kinases has resulted in the identification of a series of
5,6-dihydrobenzo [h]quinazolin-2-amines with activity as fibroblast
growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Herein we
describe the combination of a proprietary in silico design process, a new
screening paradigm using an array of biochemical and biophysical
technologies in conjunction with an established parallel chemistry
process for the identification and optimization of a series of novel FGFR
inhibitors. These potent FGFR inhibitors exhibit a preference for the
inactive form of the kinase, are non-ATP competitive, and exhibit robust
cellular pharmacodynamic inhibition as well as in vitro
anti-proliferative effects in cells dependent on FGFR and significant
anti-tumor activity in appropriate xenograft models in vivo. The design
strategy, synthesis, structure activity relationships and in vitro and in
vivo biology of selected inhibitors will be presented.
