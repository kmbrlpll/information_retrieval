Title: A secreted tissue engineered extracellular matrix (shECM) prevents
recurrence in post-resection pancreatic cancer models


Pancreatic cancer is a highly treatment-resistant cancer. Gemcitabine,
which is first-line therapy, results in toxicity without meaningful
survival benefit. We report here that a extracellular matrix (ECM)
secreted by human embryone fibroblasts in culture inhibit human
pancreatic cancer growth and post-surgical recurrence in an orthotopic
nude mouse models. Post-resection, all untreated control mice had
recurrent disease. In contrast, only 2 of 8 mice (p=0.004) in the
treatment group had palpable masses after 6 weekly intravenous
treatments. In a second study, targeting the one surgical site with ECM
treatment followed by 8 weekly i.p. treatments of ECM, 7 of 8 treated
mice survived beyond 10 weeks while none of the untreated control mice
survival 8 weeks. No measurable toxicity was observed in the treatment
group. These results demonstrate the potential of ECM treatment of
pancreatic cancer.
