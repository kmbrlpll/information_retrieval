Title: Clinical profiles predict early non-adherence to adjuvant
endocrine treatment in a prospective breast cancer cohort


Non-adherence to adjuvant endocrine breast cancer treatment adversely
affects disease-free and overall survival. Clinical predictors of
non-adherence may allow for specific interventions to reduce
non-adherence and improve survival. The aim was to investigate whether
clinical characteristics predict non-adherence. Clinical characteristics
and information on adherence were obtained from 417 breast cancer
patients in a population-based prospective cohort from southern Sweden
using patient charts, pathology reports, and questionnaires filled out at
the 1- and 2-year follow-up visits. A BMI72% of the non-adherent
patients. Thirteen non-adherent patients declined treatment and were
never prescribed endocrine treatment. In conclusion, two clinical
profiles predicted early non-adherence and may be clinically useful if
validated in an independent cohort.
