Title: Non-targeting siRNA induces NPGPx expression to cooperate with
exoribonuclease XRN2 for releasing the stress


Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) target specific mRNAs for their
degradation mediated by RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Persistent
activation of siRNA-RISC frequently leads to non-targeting toxicity.
However, how cells mediate this stress remains elusive. In this
communication, we found that the presence of non-targeting siRNA
selectively induced the expression of an ER-resident protein,
non-selenocysteine containing phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione
peroxidase (NPGPx), but not other ER-stress proteins including GRP78,
Calnexin, and XBP1. Cells suffering from constant non-targeting siRNA
stress grew slower and prolonged G1 phase, while NPGPx-depleted cells
accumulated mature non-targeting siRNA and underwent apoptosis. Upon the
stress, NPGPx covalently bound to exoribonuclease XRN2, facilitating XRN2
to remove accumulated non-targeting siRNA. These results suggest that
NPGPx serves as a novel responder to non-targeting siRNA-induced stress
in facilitating XRN2 to release the non-targeting siRNA accumulation.
