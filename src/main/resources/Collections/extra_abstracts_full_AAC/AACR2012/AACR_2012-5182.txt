Title: Real-time molecular imaging of v-integrin GFP-expression in
osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo


We describe here real-time imaging of v integrin-GFP expression in
osteosarcoma cells (143B) in vitro and in vivo. 143B cells were stably
transfected with an v integrin-GFP vector. Confocal microscopy
demonstrated that v integrin immunofluorescent staining colocalized with
v integrin-GFP fluorescence. In vitro, when v integrin-GFP osteosarcoma
cells were seeded on a dish coated with fibronectin, which bonds v
integrin. v integrin adhesion plaques were observed by confocal
microscopy using the Olympus FV1000. When v integrin-GFP-expressing 143B
cells (1106) were transplanted in the tibia or injected subcutaneously in
nude mice, the cells aligned along collagen orthotopic fibers. In the
orthotopic model, osteosarcoma cells punctate expression of v
integrin-GFP was imaged in the osteosarcoma cells as they invaded
muscular tissue. In the subcutaneous model, osteosarcoma cells, strongly
expressing v integrin-GFP, were observed around the blood vessels in the
tumor. These results show that v integrin-GFP allows the real-time
imaging of the role of v integrin during cancer cell invasion allowing
the further understanding of its role in the process.
