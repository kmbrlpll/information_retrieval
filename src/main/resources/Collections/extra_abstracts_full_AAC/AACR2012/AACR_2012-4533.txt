Title: Characteristics of HS6ST2 expression in colorectal cancer


Background. We have found that the gene expression of heparin sulfate
D-glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfotransferase-2 (HS6ST2) is overexpressed in
colorectal cancer in a previous study. Aims of this study are to evaluate
the HS6ST2 expression in colorectal cancer tumor samples in relation to
the clinicopathological features. Methods. The mRNA expression levels of
HS6ST2 were analyzed in various cancer cell lines using real-time RT-PCR.
HS6ST2 protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Tumor
specimens were obtained from 103 colorectal cancer patients operated in
Kinki University Hospital. Results. High mRNA expression was observed in
2/15 (13%) of gastric cancer and 3/6 (50%) of colorectal cancer cell
lines. In immunohistochemistry analysis, cytoplasm staining was found in
cancer cells, not in normal colon cells, and positive staining of HS6ST2
expression was seen in 37 patients (36.3%). There were no relationships
between clinicopathological features and HS6ST2 expression in cancer
cells. Colon cancer patients with HS6ST2 expression tend to have worse
overall survival (p = 0.097, Log-rank test).Conclusion. The cytoplasm
expression of HS6ST2 is tumor-specific in colon tissues. HS6ST2 may
contribute to be worse outcome.
