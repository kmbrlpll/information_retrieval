Title: EGFR interacts with fatty acid synthase


Background: Over expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) is common in cancers. It has been
found that de novo fatty acid synthesis accounts for >90% of total
cellular lipids in cancer cells. In this study, we found that EGFR
physically interacts with FASN and this interaction is independent of
EGFR kinase activity. Methods: We created fourteen flag tagged domain
deleted EGFR, and transfected them with FASN into HEK293T cells, and
performed Co-immuno-precipitation (Co-IP) followed by Western blot
analysis. Results: We found EGFR interacted with FASN independent of EGFR
kinase activity. Fine scale domain mapping revealed that the
transmembrane (TM) and intracellular domains of EGFR are necessary for
the EGFR-FASN interaction. The extracelluar domains of L1 and LF are also
required for a sufficient EGFR-FASN interaction. Conclusions: EGFR
interacts with FASN independent of its tyrosine kinase activity and that
the transmembrane and intracellular domain of EGFR is critical for the
interaction between EGFR and FASN.
