Title: Detection of PIGO-deficient cells using proaerolysin: a valuable
tool to investigate mechanisms of mutagenesis in the DT40 cell system


A DNA damage response analysis makes use of the chicken DT40 isogenic
cell line and its dozens of available mutants knocked out in various DNA
repair and cell cycle pathways. While this DT40 cell system is valuable
for understanding the DNA damage response to genotoxic agents, no
convenient mutation assay for mutagens currently exists for this
reverse-genetic system. Here we establish a proaerolysin (PA)
selection-based mutation assay in DT40 cells to identify
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor deficient cells. Using PA, we
detected an increase in the number of PA-resistant DT40 cells exposed to
MMS for 24 hours followed by a 5-day period of phenotype expression. GPI
anchor synthesis is catalyzed by a series of phosphatidylinositol glycan
complementation groups (PIGs). The PIG-O gene is on the sex chromosome
(Chromosome Z) in chicken cells and is critical for GPI anchor synthesis
at the intermediate step. We identified that all PA-resistant DT40 cells
analyzed have mutations in the PIG-O gene. This novel assay for DT40
cells provides a valuable tool to investigate the mode of action of
mutations caused by reactive agents using a series of isogenic mutant
DT40 cells.
