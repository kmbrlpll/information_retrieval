Title: Computational modeling of pancreatic cancer reveals growth and
dissemination kinetics and suggests optimum treatment strategies


Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death, largely due
to metastatic dissemination. We investigated pancreatic cancer
progression by utilizing a mathematical framework of metastasis formation
together with comprehensive data of 228 patients, 101 of whom had
autopsies. We found that pancreatic cancer growth is initially
exponential. After estimating the rates of pancreatic cancer growth and
dissemination, we determined that patients likely harbor metastases at
diagnosis and predicted the number and size distribution of metastases as
well as patient survival. These findings were validated in an independent
database. Finally, we analyzed the effects of different treatment
modalities, finding that therapies which efficiently reduce the growth
rate of cells earlier in the course of treatment appear to be superior to
upfront tumor resection. These predictions can be validated in the
clinic. Our interdisciplinary approach provides insights into the
dynamics of pancreatic cancer metastasis and identifies optimum
therapeutic interventions.
