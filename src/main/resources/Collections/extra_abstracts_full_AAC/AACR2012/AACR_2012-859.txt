Title: CDK11 (PITSLRE) kinase expression is critical for human cancer
cell growth and proliferation


In the search to identify kinases required for human cancer cell growth,
we found CDK11 (PITSLRE) by a comprehensive human kinome-wide shRNA
screen to be critical for human cancer cell growth and proliferation. We
observed that the expression level of CDK11 was elevated in a variety of
human cancer cells and tumor tissues. Furthermore, knock-down of CDK11
either by lentiviral shRNA or by synthetic siRNA inhibits cell growth and
induces apoptosis in human cancer cells. In these cells, suppression of
CDK11 reduces the expression of several antiapoptotic genes essential for
tumor cell survival and proliferation including MCL-1, BcL-XL and
survivin. We showed by immunohistochemical analysis that osteosarcoma and
ovarian cancer patients with high CDK11 tumor expression levels were
associated with significantly shorter survival than patients with lower
expression levels of CDK11 expression. Systemic administration of In Vivo
Ready siRNA of CDK11 reduced tumor growth in an osteosarcoma s.c.
xenograft model. Taken together, these observations suggest that CDK11
signaling is essential in human cancer cell growth and survival. CDK11
may serve as a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of human
cancer.
