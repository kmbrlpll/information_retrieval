Title: Bcl-2 suppresses cell spreading, adhesion and migration in
non-small cell lung cancer cells


Bcl-2 is mainly thought to regulate cell apoptosis. However, little is
known about its regulation associated with cell metastasis. Here, we
demonstrate that Bcl-2 plays an important role in the cell spreading,
adhesion and migration of non-small cell lung cancer cells. To study the
role of Bcl-2, mutant cell lines exhibiting stably up-regulated and
down-regulated Bcl-2 were generated using Bcl-2 plasmid and RNA
interference. As compared to control H460 cells, Bcl-2 overexpressed
cells exhibited significantly decreased cell spreading, adhesion and
migration. Consistent with these results, the loss of Bcl-2 in Bcl-2
knockdown cells increased cell spreading, adhesion and migration. The
morphology characteristics study has shown that Bcl-2 increased
mesenchymal-epithelial transition phenotype whereas the loss of Bcl-2
increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype. The increase of
fluorescent intensity of phalloidin staining in Bcl-2 overexpressed cells
suggesting actin polymerization might be responsible in the supression of
cell spreading, adhesion and migration. This result may explain why Bcl-2
has been suggested as a prognostic factor for survival in lung cancer
patients.
