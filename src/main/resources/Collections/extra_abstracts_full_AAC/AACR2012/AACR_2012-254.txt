Title: Genome-wide shRNA screening identifies candidate proteins
modulating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway


Apoptosis is a highly regulated process critical for embryonic
development, and tissue and organ homeostasis. Deregulation of apoptosis
is a common occurrence in cancer. Emerging oncology therapeutic agents
designed to engage apoptosis are currently undergoing clinical
investigations. To identify unknown proteins that modulate the
sensitivity to death receptor DR5 targeted agent drozitumab and to
uncover predictive biomarkers, we perform a genome-wide screening of
18,000 genes by using pooled short hairpin RNA libraries, followed by the
next generation sequencing for candidate identification. We have
identified and confirmed candidate shRNA constructs and target genes that
resulted in selective desensitizing of the cells to drozitumab. The roles
and mechanisms of action of the newly identified proteins in modulating
the extrinsic apoptotic pathway will be presented.
