Title: New advances in regulation of senescence by PML and the PML
nuclear bodies


Senescence is a cellular defense mechanism activated by short telomeres,
DNA damage or expression of oncogenes. The program includes the
expression of high levels of the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML that
form nuclear spherical bodies, known as PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NB). The
expression of PML in normal fibroblasts is sufficient to induce
senescence while genetic inactivation of PML inhibits the process. These
results suggest that PML is a critical component of the senescence tumor
suppressor mechanism. Accordingly PML is poorly expressed in malignant
human tumors but highly expressed in benign tumors. We recently
discovered a new mechanism of regulation of RAS-induced senescence by
PML, which implicates the recruitment of the RB/E2F complex to the PML-NB
via RB-PML interaction. This leads to inhibition of cell cycle and DNA
repair genes, DNA damage, p53 activation and ultimately to senescence. We
show now that the cyclin dependent kinase CDK4 blocks the ability of PML
to regulate E2F gene expression and senescence and that CDK inhibitors
potentiate the ability of PML to restore the senescence program in tumor
cells.
