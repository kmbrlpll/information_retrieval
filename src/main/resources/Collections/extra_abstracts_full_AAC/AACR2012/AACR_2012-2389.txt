Title: A microfluidic system for the selection of circulating tumor cells
that utilizes both affinity and size capture technologies


Cancer is a disease of uncontrolled cell growth and dissemination. As
tumors increase in size and vascularity, populations of cells break off
from the primary tumor, enter into the circulation, and are transported
to distant parts of the host. These circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may
constitute a seed population that is responsible for subsequent growth of
additional tumors (metastasis) in different tissues. Therefore capture,
and subsequent characterization of CTCs from patient's blood, offers an
opportunity to both study and monitor progression of the disease. One of
the most common methodologies used for CTC capture is affinity based,
where specific antibodies bind to cell surface antigens and allow cell
capture. A second technique employs size filtration. CTCs are generally
larger than normal leukocytes and this size differential can be exploited
to enrich CTCs. Here we describe a CTC dual capture platform developed at
On-Q-ity Inc. that combines both of these isolation techniques to offer
more efficient CTC capture than either technology alone. Performance of
On-Q-ity platform will be compared to Veridex's CellSearch. Utility of
On-Q-ity platform for sophisticated molecular and cellular
characterization of captured cells will also be described.
