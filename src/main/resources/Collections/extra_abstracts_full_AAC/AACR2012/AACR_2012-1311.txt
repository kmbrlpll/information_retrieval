Title: Expression and activity of nuclear factor TOX3 in breast cancer


Our laboratory has shown that thymocyte selection-associated HMG-box
protein (TOX) is a member of a small subfamily of DNA binding factors,
and a key regulator of multiple aspects of immune system development.
Recently, genome wide association studies have mapped a breast cancer
susceptibility locus to the gene encoding the TOX-family member TOX3.
However, little is known concerning the pattern of expression or
biological functions of TOX3 in breast cancer and normal mammary
epithelial cells. We find that TOX3 is specifically expressed in estrogen
receptor (ER+) mammary luminal epithelial cells. Interestingly, using a
TOX3 monoclonal antibody developed by our laboratory, we identify a
subset of breast tumors that highly express TOX3. Moreover, using the
MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, we find that TOX3 regulates a subset of ER
target genes in an estrogen independent but ER dependent manner,
potentially revealing a novel mechanism of ER target gene activation. In
addition, TOX3 enhances cell migration. Together, these studies lend
support to the idea of altered TOX3 expression influencing breast cancer
development and/or progression.
