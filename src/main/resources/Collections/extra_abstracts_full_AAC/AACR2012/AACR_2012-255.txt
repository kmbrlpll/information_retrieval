Title: Identification of a novel TRAIL sensitizer in TRAIL-resistant
cancer cells


The Tumor Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL), a
TNF-family member is a highly promising agent for cancer therapy as it
selectively induces apoptosis in various cancer cells but not in normal
cells. However, many primary tumors are resistant to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis and the resistant mechanisms are not fully understood. To
identify novel TRAIL signaling regulatory molecules, we screened a siRNA
library that target 719 whole human protein kinases in TRAIL-resistant
lung cancer cell line (A549 cell). As a screening result, we identified a
member of NIMA-related kinases as a new regulator of TRAIL-induced cell
death. NEK family play key role in controlling mitosis but the role in
TRAIL signaling was not elucidated. Down-regulation of NEK by siRNA
dramatically increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in TRAIL resistant cancer
cells including A549 cells. However it was not effective on both
etoposide and TNF/CHX-mediated apoptosis. In addition, inhibition of NEK
highly activated caspase-3 in response to TRAIL. On the other hand,
over-expression of NEK reduced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in TRAIL sensitive
cells. Our findings suggest that NEK is a novel negative modulator of
TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer cells.
