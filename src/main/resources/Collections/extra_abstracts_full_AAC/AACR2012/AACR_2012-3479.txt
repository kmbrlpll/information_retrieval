Title: Targeting FoxM1 selectively depletes hepatic cancer stem cells


Over-expression of the Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) transcription factor
coincides with highly aggressive, poorly differentiated hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). Over-expression of FoxM1 in HCC also correlates with
poorer overall survival after hepatectomy. Since HCC progression involves
hepatic cancer stem cells (HCSCs), we considered the roles of FoxM1 in
HCSCs. We found that FoxM1 expression correlates with the expression of
the stemness genes in human HCC cell lines. Interestingly, depletion of
FoxM1 in human HCC lines causes a selective reduction in the population
of the CD90+ HCSCs due to selective apoptosis. Moreover, FoxM1 silencing
decreases sphere formation potential of the same cell lines, suggesting
that FoxM1 is critical for survival of the HCSCs. Consistent with the
loss of HCSCs, depletion of FoxM1 causes decrease in tumorigenic
potential of the HCC cells in vitro as well as inhibition of tumor
formation in mouse xenografts. Furthermore, we found that FoxM1 directly
regulates expression of CD44, previously shown to be important for the
tumorigenic potential of CD90+ HCC cells. These studies have exciting
implications in further considerations of FoxM1 as a target of HCC
therapy.
