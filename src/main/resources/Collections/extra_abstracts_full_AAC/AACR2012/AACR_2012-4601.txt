Title: The role of nicotine-induced oxidative stress in oral cancer cells


Objective To investigate the role of nicotine-induced oxidative stress in
SCC15 oral cancer cells. Methods The growth, apoptosis, ROS level, Prx1
expression and NF-b DNA binding activity were detected in SCC15 oral
cancer cell using MTT assay, RT-PCR, Western blotting, flow cytometry,
ELISA. Results The ROS level was elevated in SCC15 cells treated with
nicotine for 24h at different concentrations (0.1M, 1M, 10M). Cell growth
was induced by nicotine for 24h, 48h at different concentrations. Few
SCC15 cells were induced apoptotic cell death treated with nicotine for
24h, there was no obvious changes in cell apoptosis for 48h, 72h,
compared with control. Prx1 mRNA and protein expression were
up-regulation treated with nicotine. NF-b DNA binding activity was
increased treated with nicotine for 24h, 48h, 72h. Conclusion Nicotine
induced oxidative stress and cell proliferation, which maybe regulated by
Prx1/NF-b axis in oral cancer cells.
