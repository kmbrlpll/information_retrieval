Title: Regulation of histone modification and chromatin structure by
p53-PADI4 pathway


Histone proteins are modified in response to various external signals,
however their mechanisms are still not fully understood. We here report
in vivo and in vitro citrullination of arginine 3 residue of histone H4
(H4R3) in response to DNA damage through the p53-PADI4 pathway. We also
observed DNA damage-induced citrullination of lamin C through the
p53-PADI4 pathway. Citrullinated H4R3 (cit-H4R3) and citrullinated lamin
C are located around fragmented nuclei in apoptotic cells. Ectopic
expression of PADI4 led to chromatin decondensation and promoted DNA
cleavage, while Padi4-/- mice exhibited resistance to radiation-induced
apoptosis in the thymus. We also found loss of function mutations of the
PADI4 gene in several cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the level of
cit-H4R3 was negatively correlated with that of p53 protein in cancer
cells and with tumor size in non-small cell lung cancer tissues. Our
findings reveal that citrullination of H4R3 would be an apoptotic histone
code to detect damaged cells and induce nuclear fragmentation, which
plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis.
