Title: Drug screening for glioblastoma patients


The modest benefits of chemotherapy for Glioblastoma (GBM) patients makes
it urgent to find potent drugs or combinations that can inhibitor tumor
cell growth and proliferation. We have devised drug screening based on
the NIH clinical collection compounds. This collection included 446
compounds that all have history of use in human clinical trials. The
positive compounds can be rapidly entered into clinical trials for GBM.
After found 22 drugs/compounds that can inhibit U87 cell proliferation
and we tested 15 available positive drugs with A172, LN443, U118 cell
line. After confirming in established serum-grown cell lines, we tested 8
FDA approved drugs in GBM primary cells with stem cell like features
isolated from fresh brain tumor tissue samples and cultured in stem cell
media. The various drug responses amongst the different patients primary
cells suggested that we may be able to personalize drugs to optimize
outcomes. In addition, we found that certain combinations of FDA approved
drug had significantly enhanced activity against GBM cells in vitro when
compared to the same agents used alone. Our work reveals that screening
drugs and combinations for GBM patient may have clinical implications.
