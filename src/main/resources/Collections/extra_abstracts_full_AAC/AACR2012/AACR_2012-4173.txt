Title: IKBKE/IKK is a prognostic marker and is required for KRAS-driven
tumorigenecity in non-small cell lung cancer


IKBKE (IKK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that belongs to the IKK
kinase family. Here we demonstrated that IKK is frequently overexpressed
and activated in NSCLC. Elevated protein levels of IKK were detected in
16/30 (52.6%) cell lines and 91/176 (51.7%) primary tumors. Alterations
of IKBKE are associated with overall survival but not tumor stage and
grade. Enforcing expression of IKBKE decreases whereas knockdown of IKBKE
increases the apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Notably,
suppression of IKBKE selectively induced cell death and inhibited tumor
growth in NSCLC cell lines that depend on oncogenic K-Ras expression.
Mechanistically, knockdown of IKBKE largely abrogated activating mutation
of K-Ras-induced NFB activation. These data suggest that IKBKE could be a
poor prognostic marker and mediates K-Ras oncogenic function and
signaling to NFB.
