Title: Autophagic cell death induced by curcumin is mediated by
p38/Beclin 1 to crosstalk with apoptotic cell death in DU145 cells


Curcumin as an anticancer agent was investigated to study how it can
regulate cancer cells destination to either apoptosis or autophagy. At
higher concentration, curcumin induced ROS production leading to JNK and
p38 phosphorylation in DU-145 prostate cancer cell. Of the two MAP
kinases, p38 was phosphorylated earlier during curcumin treatment, and
responsible for curcumin-induced autophagic cell death by using GFP-LC3
expression. p38-induced autophagy signaling pathway occurred at even 1h,
and was enhanced by blocking JNK signaling, and JNK signaling was more
involved in apoptosis rather than autophagy. In the case of curcumin
treatment. Beclin 1, an essential autophagic protein was mainly activated
by dissociation from Bcl2 or Bcl-xL after Beclin 1 phosphorylation
induced by p38-DAPK, or from Bcl-2 phosphorylation induced by JNK1. Based
on these results, we concluded that curcumin exhibited cytotoxicity in
DU-145 cells and this cytotoxicity was mediated by p38 signaling pathway
triggering both beclin 1 activation to induce autophagic cell death,
which in turn inhibits the apoptotic cell death induced by
curcumin-ROS-JNK signaling cascade, leading to a complex crosstalk
between autophagy and apoptosis.
