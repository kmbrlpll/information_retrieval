Title: An abdominal imaging window for long-term subcellular
visualization of abdominal organs in living mice


Intravital imaging windows are powerful tools for long-term visualization
of dynamic cell behaviour in living mice. However, the applications of
the current windows are limited because they cannot be used for imaging
of organs in the abdomen. In order to overcome this unmet need, we
developed the abdominal imaging window (AIW). Using the AIW, we
visualized stem cells in the small intestine, lymphocytes in the spleen,
transplanted islets of Langerhans under the kidney capsule, and
metastatic outgrowth of tumor cells in the liver. We discovered that
liver metastases are grown from a single founder cell, and that tumor
cells within a growing metastasis are highly motile. Strikingly, this
migration appears to be a novel, limiting step during liver metastasis
formation. We conclude that the AIW is a powerful tool to visualize
distinct biological processes in a variety of abdominal organs with
subcellular resolution over a time span of weeks.
