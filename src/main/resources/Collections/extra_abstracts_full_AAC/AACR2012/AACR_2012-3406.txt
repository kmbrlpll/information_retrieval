Title: Impact of TJP-1 and TWIST expression on post-operative prognosis
in hepatocellular carcinoma


Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in cancer
progression and metastasis. However, whether the overexpression of
EMT-related genes mediates the malignant phenotype in HCC remains largely
unclear. In this study, we examined the relationship between mRNA
expression levels of EMT-related genesand 12 clinical characteristics
including recurrence-free survival and overall survival in HCC patients
who had undergone curative hepatic resection. The mRNA expression levels
of 15 genes (CDH1, CDH2, Snail, Slug, ZEB1, ZEB2, TWIST, Vimentin,
Fibronectin, DDR2, S100A4, TJP-1/ZO-1, FOXC2, SIX1, GSC) was determined
by quantitative real-time PCR in tissues from 72 HCC tumors. Twist
expression was significantly upregulated in recurrence group (p=0.02).
The upregulation of Twist and the downregulation of TJP1 were
significantly related with poor prognosis in univariate and multivariate
analysis. In conclusion, Twist and TJP1 may be predictive biomarkers in
patients with HCC after hepatectomy. Our findings provide a novel insight
into TJP1 and HCC, warranting further investigations.
