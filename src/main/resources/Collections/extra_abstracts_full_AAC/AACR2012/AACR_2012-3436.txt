Title: Suppression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by a
wound-healing gene, Grainyhead-like-2


Grainyhead genes are involved in wound healing and developmental neural
tube closure. In light of the high degree of similarity between the
epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) occurring in wound healing
processes and the cancer stem cell-like compartment of tumors, including
TGF--dependence, we investigated the role of a Grainyhead gene (GRHL2) in
oncogenic EMT. Grainyhead was specifically down-regulated in the
claudin-low subclass of mammary tumors and in the basal-B subclass of
breast cancer cell lines. Functionally, GRHL2 suppressed TGF--induced,
Twist-induced or spontaneous EMT, enhanced anoikis-sensitivity, and
suppressed mammosphere generation in mammary epithelial cells. These
effects were mediated in part by its suppression of ZEB1 expression, by
direct repression of the ZEB1 promoter. GRHL2 also inhibited
Smad-mediated transcription, and up-regulated mir200b/c as well as the
TGF- receptor antagonist, BMP2. The expression of GRHL2 in the breast
cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 triggered a mesenchymal-to-epithelial
transition and sensitized the cells to anoikis. These results indicate
that GRHL2 is a suppressor of the oncogenic EMT, and provide a novel
molecular focus for the wound-healing/oncogenic EMT relationship.
