Title: In situ mutation detection in cancer tissue sections for research
and diagnostics in clinical oncology


Activating oncogenic mutations are targets for a new generation of cancer
drugs. Current mutation assays for clinical diagnostics are based on
DNA-extracts from tissue sections that often contain morphologically
heterogeneous neoplastic regions with variable mixtures of normal stromal
and inflammatory cells. We have developed an RNA-based in situ mutation
assay that can target oncogenic mutations in a multiplex fashion on
tissue slides by the use of multiple mutation-specific padlock probes and
rolling-circle amplification. For EGFR therapy prediction, we demonstrate
reliable in situ detection of KRAS mutations in codon 12 and 13 in colon
and lung cancer - on cytologic tumor imprints as well as on fresh frozen
and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. High throughput
screening of KRAS mutation status was successfully performed on a tissue
microarray. Moreover, we show how the pattern of expressed mutated and
wild-type alleles can be studied in situ from tumors with complex
combinations of mutated EGFR, KRAS and TP53. This in situ method holds
great promise as a tool to investigate the role of somatic mutations
during tumor progression and for prediction of response to targeted
therapy.
