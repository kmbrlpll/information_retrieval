Title: Development of an AKT1-specific synbody that inhibits MOLT-4 cell
growth


Our group has developed bivalent peptide affinity ligands, called
synbodies, to a number of proteins, including the serine / threonine
kinase, AKT1. However, despite the high affinity of the synbody for AKT1
(KD = 1.5 nM), questions remain about the use of this synbody as a probe
to modulate AKT1 activity within the cell due to the impermeability of
most peptide ligands. In this presentation, we demonstrate that the AKT1
synbody penetrates mammalian cells and localizes with AKT1 in MOLT-4
acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The synbody specifically binds AKT1
but not AKT2 or AKT3 in the cytoplasm of MOLT-4 cells demonstrating a
level of specificity typically only achieved by antibodies, which do not
normally penetrate the cell. It was also found that after 24 hours of
treatment, the synbody inhibits growth of MOLT-4 cells with an IC50 of 5
uM. FACS analysis revealed that the synbody induces apoptosis by altering
the downstream activity of AKT1. We are currently confirming the
mechanism of action of the synbody as well as preparing modifications to
increase the activity and in vivo stability of the synbody.
