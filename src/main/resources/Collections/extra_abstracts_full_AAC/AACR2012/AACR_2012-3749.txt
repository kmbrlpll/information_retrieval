Title: Single agent activity of PIK3CA inhibitor BYL719 in a broad cancer
cell line panel


NVP-BYL719 is a p110 isoform-specific small molecule inhibitor that is
currently in a Phase I clinical trial. To identify cancer populations
that most likely to respond to BYL719 treatment, we initiated a
comprehensive in vitro pharmacologic profiling screen across a large
panel of cancer cell lines that have been previously characterized at the
molecular level as part of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)
effort. We found that BYL719 responsive cell lines are enriched in
indications such as Her2 positive and luminal breast cancer, while
lacking in other indications such as Glioblastoma and Melanoma. Further
exploration of the underlying genetic and pathway aberrations revealed
that BYL719 sensitivity is positively associated with PIK3CA mutation,
ERBB2 amplification and PIK3CA amplification/copy number gain. PTEN and
BRAF mutations on the other hand, are associated with BYL719
insensitivities. KRAS mutation alone is neither associated with enhanced
sensitivity nor insensitivity, however, co-commitant PIK3CA and KRAS
mutants are more likely to be insensitive to BYL719 treatment. These
findings will help to guide our clinical development plan.
