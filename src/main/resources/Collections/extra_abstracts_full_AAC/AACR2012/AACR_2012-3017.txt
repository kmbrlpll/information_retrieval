Title: Oct4B mediates hypoxia induced epithelial mesenchymal
trans-differentiation of lung cancer


Hypoxia, a reduction of normal oxygen levels in cells or tissues, creates
a variety of changes in cell metabolism, eliciting a set of genes
involved in tissue development and cancer progression. Though Oct4, a
homebox transcription factor, is essential for self-renewal of embryonic
stem cells, little is known about the functional role of Oct4 in
tumorigenesis. In this study, we discovered that hypoxia induces a short
isoform of Oct4, termed as Oct4B, in lung cancer through a HIF-2
dependent pathway. Oct4B induced cell proliferation,
anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft tumor formation of lung
cancer cells, indicating the oncogenic potential of Oct4B. Moreover,
ectopic expression of Oct4B in lung cancer cells induced epithelial
mesenchymal tans-differentiation (EMT), promoting cell migration and
invasion. We observed that Oct4B bound to Slug promoter upon hypoxia
stimulation, promoting EMT as well as invasion of lung cancer cells.
Thus, our findings provide a novel mechanism of how Oct4B mediates
hypoxia signaling to encourage malignancy of lung cancer.
