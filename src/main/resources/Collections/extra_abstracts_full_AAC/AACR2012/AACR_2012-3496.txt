Title: Self-renewal as a therapeutic target in human colorectal cancer


Tumor recurrence following treatment remains a major clinical challenge.
Evidence from xenograft models and human trials indicates selective
enrichment of cancer-initiating cells (C-ICs) in tumors that survive
therapy. Together with recent reports showing that C-IC gene signatures
influence patient survival, these studies predict that targeting
self-renewal, the key stemness property unique to C-ICs, may represent a
new paradigm in cancer therapy. Here we demonstrate that tumor formation,
and more specifically human colorectal C-IC function are dependent on the
canonical self-renewal regulator BMI-1. Down-regulation of BMI-1 inhibits
the ability of colorectal C-ICs to self-renew resulting in the abrogation
of their tumorigenic potential. Treatment of primary colorectal cancer
xenografts with small molecule BMI-1 inhibitors resulted in colorectal
C-IC loss with long-term and irreversible impairment of tumor growth.
Targeting the Bmi-1 related self-renewal machinery provides the basis for
a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of colorectal cancer.
