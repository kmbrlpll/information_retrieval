Title: Tumor regulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cell proliferation,
circulation and apoptosis.


In response to stress, myeloid progenitor cells (MPCs) mobilize and
establish sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) within lymphoid and
parenchymal organs. We report that the spleens of 4T1 mammary
tumor-bearing (TB) mice are the primary site of MPC proliferation
resulting in extensive EMH in association with decreased apoptosis,
increased myeloid cell survival, and increased hematopoietic growth
factor (GF) transcription by the tumor cells. MPC trafficking and
survival differs between TB and nave mice with leukocyte arrest in the
lungs of nave mice and accumulation in the splenic red pulp of TB mice
with little marrow or tumor arrest or proliferation. Indeed, despite the
high levels of GF transcription by tumor cells MDSC apoptosis in tumors
is very high perhaps due to the high levels of NOS2 in the tumor
microenvironment. Further myeloid proliferation directly correlates with
the decrease in T-cell frequency, which is associated with extrathymic,
but not thymic T-cell proliferation. In summary, tumor cytokines regulate
a dynamic relationship between MPCs and T-cells regulating their
proliferation, trafficking, accumulation, apoptosis, and survival.
