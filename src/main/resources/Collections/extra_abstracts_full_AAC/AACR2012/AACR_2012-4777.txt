Title: Computational strategies for finding protein targets of flavonoids


Plant-based polyphenols (i.e., phytochemicals) have been used as
treatments for human ailments for centuries. The mechanisms of action of
these plant-derived medicines are a now major topic of investigation.
Thousands of phytochemicals have been isolated, and a certain number of
them have shown activities or effects on different disease models. Using
conventional approaches to select the best or group of the best chemicals
for studying the effectiveness in treating or preventing disease is
extremely challenging. We have developed and used computational-based
methodologies that provide an efficient and inexpensive tools to gain
further understanding of the anticancer and therapeutic effects exerted
by polyphenols. Computational strategies involving virtual screening,
shape and pharmacophore analysis and molecular docking have been used to
select chemicals that target a particular protein or enzyme and to
determine potential protein targets for well-characterized as well as for
novel polyphenols.
