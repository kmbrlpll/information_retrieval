Title: Identifying targets for melanoma therapy: Biological and clinical
implications of BRAF L597 mutants


Recurrent driver mutations in BRAF (V600), NRAS (G12/13, Q61), KIT (W557,
V559, L576, K642, D816), GNAQ (Q209) and GNA11 (Q209) have previously
been identified in malignant melanomas, but over one-third of cases have
no known potentially actionable targets. To identify novel drivers, we
performed whole-genome sequencing of a tumor-normal pair from a patient
with an aggressive, chemotherapy-nave metastatic melanoma which was
pan-negative for the mutations listed above. Our data analysis pipeline
revealed the landscape of somatic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
insertions and deletions, copy number variations, and structural
variants. A subset of the nonsynonymous SNPs was validated by direct
sequencing, resulting in the identification of a somatic BRAF L597R
mutation. Surrogate kinase assays suggest that this mutant is sensitive
to both BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Subsequent mutational analyses showed
that BRAF L597 mutations were in 2 of 34 (6%) pan-negative tumors.
Collectively, these data demonstrate the frequency and potential
therapeutic implications of BRAF L597 mutations in melanoma.
