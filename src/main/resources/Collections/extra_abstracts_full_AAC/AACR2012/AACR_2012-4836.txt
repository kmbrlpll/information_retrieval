Title: Inhibition of PI3K/mTOR leads to adaptive resistance in
extracellular matrix attached cancer cells


The PI3K/mTOR-pathway is the most commonly deregulated pathway in
epithelial cancers and represents an important target for cancer
therapeutics. Here we show that inhibition of PI3K/mTOR in ovarian and
breast cancer 3D spheroids leads to death of inner extracellular
matrix-deprived cells, whereas matrix-attached cells are resistant.
Resistance to PI3K inhibitors is associated with upregulation of a
cellular survival program that involves both FOXO-mediated transcription
and a novel translational resistance mechanism. This program is
evolutionarily well-conserved and resembles nutrient/growth deprivation,
leading to translation of IRES-containing pro-survival mRNAs, previously
associated with cellular stress responses. Inhibition of any of several
upregulated pro-survival proteins, including Bcl-2, EGFR, or IGF1R,
abrogates resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibition in breast and ovarian cancer
cells and ovarian cancer xenografts. These studies provide a platform for
rational development of effective drug combinations through the use of
3D-based model systems together with high-throughput proteomics
approaches and identify drug combinations for further analysis as cancer
therapeutics.
