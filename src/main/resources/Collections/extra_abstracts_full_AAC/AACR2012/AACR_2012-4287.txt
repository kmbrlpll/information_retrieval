Title: M13-stabilized single-walled carbon nanotubes as nanoprobes for
second near-infrared window fluorescent imaging of targeted tumors


Second near-infrared (NIR) window light (950-1,400 nm) is attractive for
in vivo fluorescence imaging due to its deep penetration depth in tissues
and low tissue autofluorescence. Here we show genetically engineered
multifunctional M13 phage can assemble fluorescent single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWNTs) and ligands for targeted fluorescence imaging of
tumors. M13-SWNT probe is detectable in deep tissues even at a low dosage
of 2 g/mL and up to 2.5 cm in tissue-like phantoms. Moreover, targeted
probes show specific and four-fold improved uptake in prostate specific
membrane antigen positive prostate tumors compared to control
non-targeted probes. This M13 phage-based second NIR window fluorescence
imaging probe has great potential for specific detection and therapy
monitoring of hard-to-detect areas.
