Title: A quantitative model to study cell-type-specific transcriptional
regulation between MCF-7 and LNCaP


Transcriptional regulation lies at the heart of biological processes. To
further understand the regulatory mechanism, we are studying the
transcriptional networks of nuclear receptors in breast cancer cell line
MCF-7 and prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Based on whole-genome gene
expression microarray data, we observed very different transcriptional
programs induced by ligands of nuclear receptors between these two cell
lines. In order to systematically explain cell-type-specific
transcriptional regulation, we are trying to build a quantitative model
to predict gene expression in different cellular contexts under different
ligand stimulations. The model will be trained using data including
genomic binding sites of nuclear receptors (ChIP-Seq), and time-series
expression of nuclear receptors, cofactors and their target genes
(Nanostring). The output of the model will be gene expression
trajectories after ligand treatments in the two cell lines.
