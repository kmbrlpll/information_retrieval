Title: The Alpha9 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is the key mediator In
nicotine-enhanced cancer metastasis in breast cancer cells


Background/purpose: The tobacco-specific mitogen nicotine was reported to
correlate with cancer progression and tumorigenesis in breast cancer.
Metastasis is a major cause of cancer death, so the influence of nicotine
on breast cancer cell migration is also of interest. Our aim is to
elucidate the mechanisms of nicotine-enhanced migration of breast cancer
cells and thereby achieve better control of metastasis. Methods: The
influence of nicotine on breast cancer cell migration was evaluated by
trans-well and wound-healing migration assays. Receptor-mediated
migration was studied with both a small molecule. inhibitor and small
interfering RNA (siRNA). Results: The alpha9 nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor, a9nAChR, was identified in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231. Nicotine enhanced cell migration in both trans-well and
wound-healing migration assays. We used a specific inhibitor and siRNA to
demonstrate that a9nAChR is the key modulator in mediating
nicotine-enhanced breast cancer cell migration through up-regulation of
fibronectin and vimentin. Conclusion: Nicotine treatment enhanced breast
cancer metastasis through a9nAChR signaling via enhanced fibronectin and
vimentin expression.
