Title: Smyd3 catalyzes a novel methylation mark and regulates cancer cell
proliferation


SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 (Smyd3) is a lysine
methyltransferase over-expressed in liver, breast and rectal carcinomas.
We have shown that knockdown of Smyd3 has an anti-proliferative effect in
cancer cell lines and that this effect can be rescued with wild type but
not catalytically inactive Smyd3, directly linking Smyd3 catalytic
activity to proliferation. Published reports indicate Smyd3 methylates
lysine 4 of histone H3, lysine 20 of histone H4 and VEGFR1. However,
activity testing of a peptide library and intact recombinant nucleosomes
indicate that a unique methylation mark is catalyzed by Smyd3. LC-MS/MS
analysis of in vitro reaction products have identified the location of
this novel site of methylation. The existence of this novel mark and its
dependence on Smyd3 activity was confirmed in cancer cells and mouse
embryonic fibroblasts. We speculate that overexpression of Smyd3 causes
aberrant methylation and plays an important role in the deregulation of
gene expression leading to uncontrolled cellular proliferation in cancer
making Smyd3 a promising target for anti-cancer therapy.
