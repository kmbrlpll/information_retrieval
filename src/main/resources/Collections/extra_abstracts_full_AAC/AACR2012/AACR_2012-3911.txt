Title: Infrared vibrational frequency as a novel molecular descriptor for
lead optimization of PKB/Akt inhibitors


We report the use of a novel molecular descriptor used for lead
optimization of PKB inhibitors. Lead optimization remains a major rate
limiting step in drug discovery. Current methods for lead optimization
that leads to a clinical candidate often fail during clinical trials with
attrition rate as high as 9 out of 10. We re-investigated the lock and
key theory by incorporating the vibrational frequency of small molecules.
The vibrational frequency is calculated based on the summation of all
theoretical infrared vibrational frequency of each bond and normalized
via division by its molecular weight. We term this molecular descriptor
as MDIR. The MDIR is utilized as a rapid lead optimization computational
chemistry method. The MDIR correlation to affinity/inhibition at several
molecular targets shows a parabolic relationship. Quinoxalines with MDIR
values near 135 provide the best inhibition (19% INH at 10 uM) at PKB/Akt
as assessed via the Cisbio HTRF KinEASE assay. An internal control,
10-DEBC, known to have 100 % inhibition of PKB at 2.5 uM, had only a 6 %
INH @ 10 uM in the KinEASE assay.
