Title: The sterile 20-like kinase Tao-1 controls tissue growth by
regulating the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway


The Hippo tumour suppressor pathway is a complex signalling network that
controls developmental tissue growth and is frequently deregulated in
different human cancers. A key question in Hippo signalling is how the
Hippo kinase (MST1/2 in mammals) is activated by upstream regulatory
inputs to limit tissue growth. Using a genetic screen in Drosophila
melanogaster, we identified the sterile 20-like kinase, Tao-1, as a novel
Hippo pathway member that activates Hippo. Tao-1 controls various
biological phenomena including microtubule dynamics, animal behaviour and
brain development. Here, we describe a previously unappreciated role for
Tao-1 as a regulator of epithelial tissue growth by modulating activity
of the core Hippo pathway kinase cassette. Tao-1 functions together with
Hippo to activate Warts-mediated repression of Yorkie. Tao-1's ability to
control SWH pathway activity is evolutionarily conserved as human TAO1
can suppress activity of the Yorkie orthologue, YAP. Human TAO1 controls
SWH pathway activity by phosphorylating, and activating, the Hippo
orthologue, MST2. Importantly, given that Hippo pathway activity is
subverted in many human cancers, our findings identify human TAO kinases
(TAO1, TAO2 and TAO3) as candidate tumor suppressor genes.
