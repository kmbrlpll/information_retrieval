Title: K-983, an orally available small molecule inhibitor of FGFR,
demonstrated prolonged survival in a mouse orthotopic gastric cancer model


The receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR and its ligand fibroblast growth factor
(FGF) play important roles in cell growth, migration, and survival.
Dysregulation of the FGFR/FGF signaling pathway has been found in many
human malignancies. K-983 was identified as a novel, potent, and orally
active small molecule inhibitor of FGFR. The anti-tumor activity of K-983
was evaluated in a rat xenograft models. K-983 displayed dose dependent
anti-tumor efficacy. K-983 demonstrated dose dependent inhibition of FGFR
phosphorylation and prolonged survival in a mouse peritoneal
dissemination model of gastric cancer. Furthermore, K-983 was examined
using an orthotopic model of human scirrhous gastric cancer in nude
mouse. K-983 (80 mg/kg) was orally administered once daily to the mice
for 28 days. Histopathological examination revealed that K-983 inhibited
tumor growth at inoculated site, invasion in gastric wall and metastasis
to other organs. K-983 also significantly prolonged the survival of mice
in this orthotopic tumor model. In summary, these results demonstrated
the promising therapeutic potential of K-983 in anticancer therapy.
