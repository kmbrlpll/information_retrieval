Title: p38 MAPK is required for the antitumor activity of the vascular
disrupting agent DMXAA


5, 6-Dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), a potent vascular
disrupting agent, selectively destroys established tumor vasculature,
causing a rapid collapse in blood flow that ultimately leads to
inhibition of tumor growth. In this study, we explored the role of p38
MAPK in the antitumor activity of DMXAA. It was found that p38 MAPK was
critically involved in DMXAA-induced cytoskeleton reorganization in
endothelial cells and TNF- production in macrophages, both of which were
essential for DMXAA-induced vascular disruption. Inhibition of p38 MAPK
significantly attenuated DMXAA-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization
in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and TNF- production in
macrophages. In vivo, p38 MAPK inhibition attenuated the immediate
reduction in tumor blood flow induced by DMXAA treatment (4 h)
DMXAA-induced shutdown of the tumor vasculature by inhibiting
intratumoral TNF- production. Our results indicate that p38 MAPK is
required for DMXAA-induced endothelial cell cytoskeleton reorganization
and TNF- production, and thus regulates DMXAA-induced antitumor activity.
