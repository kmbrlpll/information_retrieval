Title: Mechanisms of acquired crizotinib resistance in ALK-rearranged
lung cancers


ALK fusion oncogenes represent a novel molecular target in a small subset
of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). The vast majority of patients
with ALK-positive NSCLC are highly responsive to ALK tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapy. However, these patients invariably relapse,
typically within one year, due to the development of resistance. Herein,
we report findings from the first series of patients with acquired
resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In approximately one-third of
patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations
distributed throughout the ALK TK domain. We also identified aberrant
activation of other kinases as alternative mechanisms of crizotinib
resistance. Additionally, we generated laboratory models of acquired
crizotinib resistance which closely recapitulate the diversity of
resistance mechanisms observed in patients. Our results highlight the
marked heterogeneity of TKI resistance mechanisms in ALK-positive NSCLC,
and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutic
strategies in patients who relapse on crizotinib.
