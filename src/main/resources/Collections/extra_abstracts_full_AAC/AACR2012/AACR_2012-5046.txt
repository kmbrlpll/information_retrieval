Title: miR-199a/125b inhibits tumor growth


Many human cancers of epithelial origin are associated with
overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. In
particular, ERBB2 and ERBB3 overexpression are linked with cancer
development and poor prognosis. Except ERBB2/ERBB3 gene amplification,
other mechanism(s) of ERBB2 and ERBB3 overexpression remains elusive.
Recent studies show that aberrant expressions of miRNAs are associated
with cancer development. To identify specific miRNAs for regulating ERBB2
and ERBB3 expression, we find that miR-199a and miR-125b directly target
ERBB2 and ERBB3, and are downregulated in ovarian tissues and cancer
cells. Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been observed in tumor
growth and drug resistance. Interestingly we show that increased ROS
downregulate miR-199a and miR-125b for inducing ERBB2 and ERBB3
expression. ERBB2 and ERBB3 in turn activate AKT/P70S6K1/HIF signaling
leading to tumor growth and angiogenesis. This study provides a novel
mechanism of ERBB2 and ERBB3 regulation by miR-199a and miR-125b and new
concept of ROS for inducing ERBB2 and ERBB3 in tumor growth and
angiogenesis; and establishes a rationale for using miR-199a and miR-125b
mimics and ROS scavengers as new therapeutic agents in the future.
