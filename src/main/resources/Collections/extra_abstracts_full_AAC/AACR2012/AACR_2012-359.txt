Title: Longitudinal monitoring of autotaxin-expressing tumors in vivo
using an activatable near-infrared fluorescent probe


Autotaxin (ATX) and its product lysophosphatidic acid are involved in
numerous biological functions that generally involve cell proliferation
and motility. Their dysregulation is associated with several diseases,
including many cancers, with ATX reportedly being among the forty most
upregulated genes in highly metastatic cancers. Until now there have been
no methods to visualize or measure the activity of ATX in living
organisms. Here, we monitor tumor progression in vivo using ATX-Red, a
biosensor that reports on ATX activity. We show that ATX-Red is
specifically activated by ATX to fluoresce in the near-infrared, the
optimal spectral window for in vivo fluorescence imaging. While minimal
fluorescence activation is seen when ATX-Red is administered systemically
to healthy mice, ATX-Red is strongly activated in MDA-MB-231 xenografts,
which are known to over-express ATX. Longitudinal imaging of mice bearing
these xenografts shows that ATX-Red fluorescence correlates with tumor
size. Our data demonstrate that ATX-Red is an effective and non-invasive
in vivo imaging tool that enables real time visualization and
quantitation of ATX-expressing tumor progression.
