Title: Factor dependent chromatin structure and nucleosome dynamics


Transcription factor cistromes are highly cell-type specific. Chromatin
accessibility, histone modifications and nucleosome occupancy have all
been found to play a role in defining these binding locations. Here, we
show that hormone-induced DNase I hypersensitivity changes (DHS) are
highly predictive of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER)
binding in prostate cancer and breast cancer cells, respectively. The
chromatin structure prior to binding and the nucleosome occupancy after
binding are strikingly different for ER and AR. AR binding is associated
with changes in both the local nucleosome occupancy and the DNase I
hypersensitivity. In contrast, while globally ER binding is unrelated to
changes in nucleosome occupancy, DNase I hypersensitivity dynamics
predict the ER cistrome. These findings suggest that AR and ER have
distinct modes of interaction with chromatin and that DNase I
hypersensitivity dynamics provides a general approach for predicting
cell-type specific cistromes.
