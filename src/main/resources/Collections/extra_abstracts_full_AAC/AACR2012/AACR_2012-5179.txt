Title: Inhibition of U937-cell adhesion to human endothelial cells by
glycosylated lysozyme mutants


The evascularization of cells is an important step in defense reactions
and the spreading of metastases. During inflammation, the endothelium of
the affected tissue becomes activated and interacts with cells bearing
cognate structures such as sialyl Lewis X (sLex) substances. In this
study, we present the sLex-antagonist hLysII/IV-FUCTVI by which a
significant inhibition of adhesion is achieved at 1ng/ml (0.07 nM),
making it the most potent known inhibitors of adhesion described to date.
In our study we overexpressed the glycosylated human lysozyme mutant
hLysII/IV in CHO cells stably expressing fucosyltransferases FUCIII, IV,
V, VI, or VII. Digestional analysis with endo- and exoglycosidases showed
that hLysII/IV-FUCTVI contains predominantly biantennary complex
N-glycans with a variable number of lactosamine repeats; these were
terminally sialylated and fucosylated, suggesting the presence of the
sLex antigen. In contrast, hLysII/IV-FUCTIII and IV were not terminally
sialylated and hLysII/IV-FUCV and VII were not terminally fucosylated. In
a static adhesion assay, binding of U937 to activated HUVEC cells was
exclusively blocked in the presence of medium supernatant containing
hLysII/IV-FUCTVI and by affinity-purified hLysII/IV-FUCTVI.
