Title: Discovery of a novel benzotriazole-type retinoid X receptor
partial-agonist decreasing plasma glucose level in type-2 diabetes
mellitus with decreased side effects


Insulin-independent hypoglycemic agents have attracted attention, because
type 2 diabetes mellitus is reported to be associated with an increased
risk of cancer due to mitogenic effect of insulin. Insulin-independent
antihyperglycemic effect can be obtained by LXR activation. LXR functions
as heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs). RXRs also work with
PPARs, which are known as targets for improvement of insulin resistance.
Since LXR/RXR and PPAR/RXR can be activated by RXR agonists alone, and we
are interested in RXR agonists for new hyperglycemia agents. However,
well-known RXR agonists (RXR full-agonists) show significant weight gain
and triglyceride elevation. Since these side effects are caused by excess
activation of RXR, we hypothesized that RXR partial-agonists might be
effective to decrease plasma glucose level without these problems. As a
result, CBt-PMN, which has a benzotriazole structure, was discovered as
an RXR partial-agonist, and significantly decreases plasma glucose level
in type 2 diabetes model mice without the side effects described above.
