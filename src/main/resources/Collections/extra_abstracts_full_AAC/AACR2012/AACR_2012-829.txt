Title: Down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 in
cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer


Cisplatin is an effective anticancer drug used to treat many types of
cancer, including non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLCs), but development
of resistance is the primary impediment in cancer treatment. Insulin-like
growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) is a secreted tumor suppressor
that is inactivated in human lung cancer. IGFBP7 is known to alter
sensitivity to interferon-based anticancer therapy, and here, we examined
loss of IGFBP7 as a potential contributor to chemo-resistance to
cisplatin. The transcriptional level of IGFBP7 was decreased in
cisplatin-resistant human cancer cell lines and NSCLC xenografts. IGFBP7
knock-down increased cellular resistance to cisplatin and increased the
level of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKP) 3 levels.
The expression of MKP3 increased in a cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cell line
and lung xenografts. MKP3 knock-down increased IGFBP7 level, indicating
that MKP3 regulates IGFBP7. These findings suggest a novel molecular
mechanism responsible for the tumor suppressive function of IGFBP7 in
cisplatin-resistant human lung cancer and could lead to the development
of IGFBP7 as a cisplatin-sensitizing agent.
