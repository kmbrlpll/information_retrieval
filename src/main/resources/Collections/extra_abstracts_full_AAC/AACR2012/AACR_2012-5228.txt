Title: Inhibition of myeloid cell PI3K is a potential therapeutic
approach to treat pancreatic cancer


Tumor inflammation plays a significant role in initiating and
perpetuating tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. While normal
inflammatory responses aid in wound healing, fighting infections, and
destroying pathogens, tumor inflammation is self-perpetuating and plays a
role in facilitating the disease, in part by inducing immunosuppression.
Gr1+CD11b+ myeloid cells are the most prevalent inflammatory cells found
in tumors, where they directly promote tumor angiogenesis and
immunosuppression. Recent studies in our laboratories have shown that the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit isoform p110,
which is expressed exclusively by Gr1+CD11b myeloid cells, directly
promotes myeloid cell invasion and consequently, tumor immunosuppression.
Genetic and pharmacological suppression of PI3K activity substantially
reduces myeloid cell trafficking to orthotopic Pdx1Cre;Kras+; p53+/- and
other pancreatic ductal carcinomas, reduces expression of
immunosuppressive factors, and inhibits pancreatic tumor growth and
metastasis. These studies indicate that PI3K inhibitors may be useful
therapeutics for pancreatic ductal carcinoma.
