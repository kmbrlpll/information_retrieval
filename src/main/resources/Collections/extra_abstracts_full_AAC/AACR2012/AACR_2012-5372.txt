Title: Dendritic-cell based vaccine for advanced pancreatic cancer: A
report of 39 cases treated in Seren Clinic Nagoya


Objective: In the current study, we retrospectively assessed the efficacy
of dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccine in advanced pancreatic carcinoma
(PC). Patients: From Jan 2009 to April 2010, 39 patients (19 males and 20
females; aged 32-78 years, median 64 years) with advanced PC were treated
with DC-based vaccine, and 38 patients also received GEM and/or S-1.
Methods: Patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained
by leukapheresis (400ml13 cycles), then adherent cells were cultured with
GM-CSF, IL-4, OK-432 and PGE2 to generate DCs. The DCs pulsed with tumor
specific peptides (WT1/MUC1) were injected at 2-week intervals (mean=8.3,
max= 16 vaccinations). Results: The mean observation period was 257.6
days. None of the 39 patients showed CR, but we have found out 9 cases of
PR and 9 cases of SD in accordance with RECIST. Response rate was 55% in
the patients in combination with S-1+GEM and 9% with GEM alone. Disease
control rate was 77.8% with S-1+GEM and 38% with GEM alone. Conclusions:
DC-based vaccination in combined with GEM/S-1 was shown to be safe and
possibly effective in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
