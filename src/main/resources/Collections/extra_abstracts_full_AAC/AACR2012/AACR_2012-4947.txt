Title: Analysis of structural mutations in cancer genomes


In our group, we have extensively sequenced various cancer genomes
(breast cancer, ovarian cancer and melanoma) using a range of genome-wide
sequencing approaches, including DNA-PET, RNA-SEQ and exome-capture
sequencing. Taking each tumor as a system of its own, we aim to integrate
the different outputs of these technologies to explore the composite of
hard-wired changes that drive tumorgenesis in different cancers. One type
of hard-wired changes is copy number alterations, where the cancer genome
tends to gain oncogenes and lose tumor suppressors by DNA amplifications
and deletions respectively. While copy number variation data are now a
standard output of the DNA-PET pipeline, the accurate prediction of copy
number gains and losses is further complicated by several issues,
including normal tissue contamination, tumor heterogeneity and
aneuploidy. I will present my current work to deconvolute the
contribution of these factors to the copy number profile. I will also
discuss the classification of our sequenced cancer genomes into various
chromotypes based on their unique copy number signatures. I will show how
different chromotypes are enriched in specific types of structural
variations, which may underlay alternative mechanisms of genomic
instability promoting cancer evolution.
