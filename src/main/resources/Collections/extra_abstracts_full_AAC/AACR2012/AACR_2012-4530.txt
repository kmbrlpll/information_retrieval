Title: A novel blood-based method for evaluating KRAS in circulating
microvesicles from colorectal cancer patients


Circulating microvesicles (cMV) are lipid-encapsulated bodies that are
secreted from various tissues and can be detected in a number of body
fluids, including plasma. Once collected from plasma, they can be
exploited diagnostically for their protein and RNA signatures. Mutations
in KRAS are diagnostically important for predicting response to
chemotherapy and prognosis. A blood-based method of assessing KRAS
mutation status would be helpful for patients with colorectal cancer
(CRC). Traditional methods of KRAS detection examine the genomic DNA
sequence. We developed a method to sequence exon 3 from KRAS using
Pyrosequencing. The limit of detection for the assay was 0.78 ng/uL of
mutant cDNA for both Pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing. To further
enhance mutation detection, we sorted cMV from CRC patients by first
capturing cMV with a CRC associated membrane protein and then sorting for
CD63 and CD24 positive events. A Taqman gene expression assay was not
sensitive enough to detect KRAS in the sorted samples. However,
Pyrosequencing was sufficient to identify mutant and wild-type sequences
in patient plasma samples.
