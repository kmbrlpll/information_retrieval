Title: Sensitization of head and neck cancer cells toward cisplatin by
inhibition of autophagy


Cisplatin is a commonly used chemotherapeutics but its efficacy is
limited by the resistance presented by some tumor cells. Autophagy is a
form of cell death by self-digesting organelles. The present study was
undertaken to examine whether cisplatin can induce autophagy and whether
autophagy modulates the efficacy of cisplatin against head and neck
squamous cancer cells (HNSCC). In responses to increasing doses of
cisplatin, there was a steady increase in autophagy, as indicated by LC3
punctate staining, in a cisplatin resistant UMSCC-15S cell line, whereas
induction of autophagy was rapidly peaked at low doses of cisplatin in
the UMSCC-10B cell line which was more sensitive toward cisplatin.
Further studies found that there were increased autophagic fluxes at
basal level in the cisplatin sensitive UMSCC-10B cells when compared to
cisplatin resistant UMSCC-15S cells. Inhibition of autophagy by
chloroquine significantly reduced colony formation of both cell lines,
and sensitized UMSCC-15S cells toward cisplatin treatment. Our studies
suggest that autophagy responses can be modulated to augment the efficacy
of cisplatin against HNSCCs.
