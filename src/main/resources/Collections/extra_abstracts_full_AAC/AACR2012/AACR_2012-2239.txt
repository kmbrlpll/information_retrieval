Title: The effect combining the KIT inhibitor Imatinib with the PI3K
inhibitor BKM120 or the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 on the
proliferation of gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell lines


Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common type of
sarcoma found in the gastrointestinal tract, with 5,000-6,000 cases per
year diagnosed in the United States. Activating mutations in KIT, or
occasionally in PDGFR are present in up to 90% of GISTs. The PI3K/AKT
pathway has been demonstrated to be a crucial survival pathway in
imatinib-resistant GISTs. In this study, we evaluated single agent
activities of the KIT inhibitor imatinib, the PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and
the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235, as well as the synergistic activity
of the combination of imatinib with BKM120 and imatinib with BEZ235 in a
panel of GIST cell lines. For example, when the antiproliferative effects
of imatinib and BKM120 were evaluated in combination at concentrations
from 0.37 M to 3.3 M, growth suppression was observed in excess of the
percent inhibition achieved by imatinib or BKM120 single agent treatment
in the GIST882 and GIST430 cell lines. Our results suggest that combining
imatinib with BKM120 or BEZ235 may provide a therapeutic strategy for
imatinib-resistant GISTs.
