Title: Imaging lung colony formation by osteosarcoma cells expressing v
integrin-GFP in nude mice


We report here imaging the behavior of v integrin linked to GFP in
osteosarcoma cells which are colonizing the lung of nude mice. 143B
osteosarcoma cells expressing v integrin-GFP were generated by
transfection of an v integrin-GFP vector. Confocal microscopy with the
FV1000 (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) demonstrated that v integrin
immunofluorescence staining colocalized with v integrin-GFP fluorescence.
To generate pulmonary colonies, osteosarcoma cells, stably expressing v
integrin-GFP, were injected intravenously (1106) via the tail vein of
nude mice. Eight weeks after injection, both lungs were harvested and
observed by confocal microscopy within 1 hour after harvesting.
Scattered-expression of v integrin-GFP was observed in the pulmonary
osteosarcoma colonies. In contrast, osteosarcoma cells strongly expressed
v integrin-GFP when aligned along the edge of colonies and around blood
vessels. Expression of v integrin-GFP can be imaged in lung metastasis
which will allow further understanding of its role in this process.
