Title: E3 ligase activity of XIAP RING domain is required for
XIAP-mediated cancer cell migration but not for its RhoGDI binding
activity


Although an increased expression level of XIAP is associated with cancer
cell metastasis in individuals with various types of cancer, the
molecular mechanism linking XIAP to cancer metastasis remains unexplored.
Here we show that in XIAP depletion HCT116 cells (XIAP/), cell migration,
invasion and actin polymerization are decreased, which could be rescued
either by the introduction of XIAP RING domain or knockdown of RhoGDI.
Subsequent studies demonstrate that this function of the XIAP RING domain
depends on its inhibition of RhoGDI SUMOylation at K138. Furthermore,
SUMO1-RhoGDI, but not un-sumoylated RhoGDI preferentially binds to Rho
GTPase and downregulates the activities of GTPases, including RhoA, Cdc42
and Rac1, by which RhoGDI inhibits cancer cellular actin polymerization
and motility. Taken together, our study reveals a novel
post-translational modification (SUMOylation) of RhoGDI, and its
physiological regulation by the RING domain of XIAP, which may account
for XIAP modulation of cancer cell motility.
