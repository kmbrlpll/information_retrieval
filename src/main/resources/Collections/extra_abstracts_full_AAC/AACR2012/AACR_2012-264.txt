Title: ENC1, a BTB/Kelch protein, links DNA-damage signals to apoptosis
by ubiquitination of retinoblastoma protein


ENC1 (ectodermal neuronal cortex 1) is a BTB/Kelch domain-containing
protein, whose gene was originally identified in a p53-overexpressing
cell line, and was later found to show abnormal expression in various
tumor tissues. Here, we report that ENC1 is a new regulator that links
DNA-damage signals to apoptosis. ENC1 is induced in different cancer
cells by DNA-damage signals. The induced ENC1 protein then interacted
with cullin-3 and retinoblastoma protein (Rb), forming an E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex and ubiquitinating Rb protein. Upon ubiquitination, Rb
protein failed to interact with E2F, allowing for transcriptional
activation of E2F-dependent genes. Inhibition of ENC1 by RNA interference
or by a dominant-negative mutant attenuated Rb ubiquitination,
E2F-depedent gene activation, as well as apoptosis induced by DNA-damage
signals. However, epitopic overexpression of ENC1 gene activated
E2F-dependent genes, but failed to trigger apoptosis. Deletion and
mutation analysis shows that a conserved motif located within Kelch
domain at the C-terminus is essential for regulation of Rb function and
apoptosis in response to DNA-damage signals.
