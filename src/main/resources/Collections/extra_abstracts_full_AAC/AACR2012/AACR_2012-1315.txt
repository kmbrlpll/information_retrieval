Title: An in vivo platform for drug screening in colorectal cancer


We aimed at generating a clinically meaningful in vivo platform for
preclinical drug screening in colorectal cancer. Surgical specimens were
collected from 143 patients, and 97 carcinomas were engrafted in
immunodeficient mouse (tumor take rate 67%). To develop in vivo platform
suitable for drug screening, 39 of xenografted carcinomas were selected
and expanded satisfactorily in mice with a mean time to reach a size of
1000-1500 mm3 of 90 20 days. In order to validate the similarity of
molecular characters between the patient tumor and carcinomas obtained
from xenografts, we conducted the mutation status, an expression array,
arrayCGH, and other molecular profiling in colon cancer to look at the
molecular progression and transition along with primary tumor, metastatic
tumor and xenograft model. Histological analysis and the molecular
profiles of tumors revealed a high degree of similarity between the
patient tumor and xenografted carcinomas. The xenografted tumors maintain
their genotypic features of original tumors, suggest that the in vivo
platform can be useful for the personalized drug development in
colorectal cancers.
