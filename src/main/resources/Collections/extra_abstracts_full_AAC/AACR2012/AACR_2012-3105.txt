Title: Chromosome 18q encodes a chromosomal instability suppressor locus
in colorectal cancer


Identifying molecular mechanisms initiating Chromosomal Instability (CIN)
may lead to approaches to limit intratumour heterogeneity and treatment
failure in cancer. Here we identify candidate CIN-suppressor genomic loci
that are subject to copy number loss in CIN colorectal cancers (CRCs).
Genes encoded within CIN-suppressor loci were characterized through an
RNA interference screen for induction of chromosome segregation errors in
mitosis, revealing 5 CIN-suppressor genes encoded on chromosome 18q.
CIN-suppressor gene silencing in chromosomally stable cells generates
structurally abnormal chromosomes, which are missegregated during
mitosis. A chromosome segregation error spectrum characteristic of
structurally abnormal chromosomes is also observed in CIN CRC cell lines.
18q loss occurs in the majority of aneuploid CRCs, and is associated with
both structural and numerical instability in colorectal tumours, and with
aneuploidy onset in a rare carcinoma-in-adenoma dataset. These data
support a role for chromosome 18q in the maintenance of chromosomal
structural integrity and mitotic fidelity, and suggest that 18q copy
number loss may initiate CIN during CRC development.
