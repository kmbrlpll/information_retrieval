Title: Frequent downregulation of NGB/GTPBP in lung cancer


GTP-binding protein NGB (GTPBP4) is located at chromosome 10p14-p15, a
region common loss in various types of human malignancy. Here, we
demonstrated that NGB expression was frequently down-regulated in human
lung cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Furthermore, we found
hypermethylation in NGB promoter region. Treatment with trichostatin A
(TSA) and 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) restored NGB expression. In
addition, the reintroduction of NGB into the cells, in which it is
downregulated, represses cell growth, colony formation, angiogenesis and
tumor growth in nude mouse. These findings indicate that NGB is a
putative tumor suppressor gene in lung cancer and could play a pivotal
role in lung carcinogenesis.
