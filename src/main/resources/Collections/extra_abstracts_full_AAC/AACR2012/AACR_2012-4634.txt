Title: Engineered cysteine drug conjugates show potency and improved
safety


Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging as an important therapeutic
option for new oncology drugs. In this abstract we present data on
engineered cysteine antibodies (EC-mAbs) with an additional unpaired
cysteine residue introduced at position 239 on each heavy chain to
facilitate more uniform drug loading while interfering with Fc gamma
receptor function. With the EC-mAb, we have identified a site that blocks
Fc gamma receptor III (CD16) binding and has a number of additional
desirable biochemical and biophysical properties. We demonstrate that
EC-mAb-drug conjugates, with two drugs per antibody, retain antitumor
activity in mouse xenograft experiments and are well tolerated in
non-human primates. These data suggest that engineered cysteine
antibodies are a potential alternative to conjugation of native cysteines
for future ADCs.
