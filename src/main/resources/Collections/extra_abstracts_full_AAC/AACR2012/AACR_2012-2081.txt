Title: Mechanisms of the acquisition of anoikis resistance in breast
cancer: Lessons from small molecule inhibitors


The Cox-2 inhibitor Celecoxib has been reported to possess
chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties, specifically in
hormonally-regulated tumors. OSU-03012 is a novel celecoxib derivative,
with no COX-2 inhibitory activity, but an order of magnitude greater cell
killing ability. We here show that this novel compound has a greater
cytotoxicity against a model of anoikis-resistant (AnR) breast cancer. In
parallel, anoikis resistance reduces AnR cell sensitivity to the ErbB1/2
dual inhibitor Lapatinib (GW572016, Tykerb, GSK). The two compounds
synergize in parental breast cancer cells. Cell killing is achieved
partially via induction of ER stress, as measured by eIF2-alpha
phosphorylation. We have found that lapatinib resistance may be induced
by the aberrant splicing of BCL-X, and that the sensitivity to OSU-03012
is likely due to PTEN dysregulation. In conclusion, these data identify a
molecule that may be more efficacious against metastatic tumors, and
partially defined its mechanism of action.
