Title: MicroRNA-101 (miR-101) posttranscriptionally regulates the
expression of EP4 receptor in colon cancers


The predominant product of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) in the colon,
prostaglandin (PG) E2 promotes carcinogenesis. Expression of the PGE2
receptor EP4 is upregulated during colorectal carcinogenesis. However the
mechanism leading to deregulation of the EP4 receptor is not known. The
present study was conducted to investigate the regulation of EP4 receptor
by miRNAs. A bioinformatics search revealed a conserved target site for
miR-101 within the EP4 receptor-3 UTR. In both colorectal cancer cell
lines and human specimens, we observed an inverse correlation between
miR-101 and EP4 receptor protein. Transfection of LS174T cells with
miR-101 significantly suppressed a luciferase reporter containing the EP4
receptor-3-UTR. In contrast, a mutant EP4 receptor-3-UTR was unaffected.
Ectopic expression miR-101 markedly reduced cell proliferation and
motility. Co-transfection of EP4 receptor could rescue colon cancer cells
from the tumor suppressive effects of miR-101. Moreover, pharmacologic
inhibition of EP4 receptor signaling or silencing of EP4 receptor
phenocopied the effect of miR-101. This is the first study to show that
the EP4 receptor is negatively regulated by miR-101.
