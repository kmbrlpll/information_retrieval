Title: Tristetraprolin (TTP) mediates radiation-induced TNF- production
in lung macrophages


The efficacy of radiation therapy for lung cancer is limited by
radiation-induced lung toxicity (RILT). Although tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-) signaling plays a critical role in RILT, the
molecular regulators of radiation-induced TNF- production remain unknown.
We investigated the role of a major TNF- regulator, Tristetraprolin
(TTP), in radiation-induced TNF- production by lung macrophages.
Tristetraprolin (TTP), an adenosine-uridine (AU) rich element (ARE)
associated RNA binding protein, is known to destabilize TNF- mRNA during
lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response and now we have
identified that radiation causes TTP inactivation via inhibitory (Ser178)
phosphorylation and induction of proteasome-mediated degradation, leading
to increased TNF- mRNA stability and secretion. Our preliminary studies
indicate possible involvements of PI3K and p38 signaling in
radiation-induced inactivating phosphorylation of TTP and we further
identify an ubiquitin ligase [Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF-TrCP)] responsible
for controlling radiation-induced TTP protein stability. These findings
suggest that agents capable of blocking TTP phosphorylation or
stabilizing TTP after irradiation could decrease RILT.
