Title: Effects of ethanol exposure during involution on mouse mammary
gland


Mammary gland involution represents a discrete developmental time point
when the breast may be particularly susceptible to risk factors
associated with mammary carcinogenesis. One dietary carcinogen which has
been shown to affect breast cancer risk in women is ethanol; as little as
one drink per day can increase breast cancer risk by 10%. The purpose of
the current study was to determine if ethanol exposure during involution
affects mammary tumor development or progression in the FVB-MMTV-Her2/Neu
transgenic mouse. Dams were fed isocaloric liquid diets containing 0,
0.5, 1 or 2% ethanol from day 1 of involution (weaning at day 21 of
lactation) until day 4, 9 or 14 post-weaning. Short-term effects of
ethanol on the progression of involution were assessed. No significant
difference in mouse weight, or organ weights (spleen, liver or kidney),
was seen between groups. Lobular regression (decrease in ducts per
lobule) occurred similarly in all dietary groups, in parallel with an
increase in average adipocyte size. No difference in leukocyte
infiltration was seen between dietary groups. Proteomic analysis and
tumor studies are ongoing.
