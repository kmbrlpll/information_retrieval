Title: Reaction of singlet oxygen with hydrazone prodrugs for the
photochemical release of N-nitrosoamine drugs


Very few visible-light activated photocleavable groups are available for
drug delivery applications. Our research was interested in assessing the
visible-light photolability of hydrazone C=N bonds via a Type II (singlet
oxygen) dye-sensitized oxygenation reaction. We have explored the
photooxidized cleavage of N-nitrosoamine by-products from
N-methylbenzophenone phenylhydrazone and methylenehydrazine model
compounds. The former was studied by gas chromatography mass spectrometry
and the latter by density functional theory calculations (DFT). We
quantified benzophenone that arose from the phenylhydrazone
photooxidation. The DFT calculations predicted a low energy route to C=N
bond fragmentation via a [2+2] pathway and an 1,2,3-dioxazetidine
reactive intermediate. The reaction was predicted to occur in stepwise
process via zwitterionic intermediates prior to forming the
dioxazetidine, and cleavage to the nitrosamine product. Further studies
are underway regarding the photolytic and hydrolytic stability of the
hydrazone C=N bond to give better insight including structure-activity
relationships, of singlet oxygen triggered photo-release of nitrosoamines.
