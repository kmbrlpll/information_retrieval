Title: HSP 70 may cause EGFR-TKIs-resistance due to inhibit drug binding
to EGFR in the cells that expressed mutant EGFR


Cancer cells that expressed mutant EGFR are more sensitive to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) than that expressed wild type
EGFR. To elucidate difference of the characteristics between wild type
and 15 bp deletion mutant EGFR, we explored the difference of
EGFR-binding proteins using respective stable transfectants, 293_pEGFR
and 293_p15. As the result, we detected heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)
specifically binds to the mutant EGFR but wild type EGFR. To examine
whether HSP70 influenced EGFR-TKI sensitivity, we examined the effect of
HSP70 inhibition. [Methods] HSP70 siRNA was exposed to the cells for 2
days. Cytotoxicity of the drugs was measured by MTT assay. The drug
binding to EGFR was measured by [14C]gefitinib. [Results] Suppression of
HSP70 by siRNA increased gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivities and
enhanced gefitinib binding to this receptor, in 293_p15 cells. Same
phenomena were observed when HSP70 was inhibited by HSP70 specific
inhibitor, 2-phenylethynesulfonamide (PES). PES inhibits HSP70 binding to
the mutant EGFR. Interestingly, this compound enhanced the EGFR
autophosphorylation and c-Cbl binding to the receptor in 293_p15 cells.
These results suggest that HSP70 may modulate EGFR activity and may cause
EGFR-TKIs-resistance due to inhibit drug binding to the mutant EGFR.
HSP70 inhibitor may possibly enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs.
