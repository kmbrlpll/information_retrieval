Title: Stabilizing but not activating -catenin by E-cad/CTF2


E-cadherin is an important mediator of cell-cell adhesion and plays a
vital role to modulate intracellular signaling pathways. E-cadherin binds
p120catenin (p120) and -catenin at cadherin homology 2 (CH2) domain and
CH3 domain, respectively. Recent studies show E-cadherin could be cleaved
by -secretase and released the intracellular C-terminal fragment 2
(E-cad/CTF2) to regulate the p120-kaiso mediated signaling pathway in the
nucleus. However, the functional effect of E-cad/CTF2 on its binding
partners, -catenin and p120, remains elusive. Here, we show E-cad/CTF2,
like full-length E-cadherin, can interact and increase the expression of
-catenin. Using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), the
transcription of -catenin mRNA is not affected by the expression of
E-cad/CTF2 or E-cadherin. Interestingly, while the nuclear expression of
-catenin is enhanced by E-cad/CTF2 or NLS-tagged E-cad/CTF2, the
transcriptional activity of -catenin does not increase. It indicates the
interaction between E-cad/CTF2 and -catenin is much stronger then
TCF4/-catenin complex. This study provides the evidence that the
transcriptional activity of -catenin is not activated by E-cad/CTF2
although the stability of -catenin is greatly enhanced by E-cad/CTF2.
