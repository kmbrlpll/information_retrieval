Title: An extensive microRNA-mediated network of RNA-RNA interactions
regulates established oncogenic pathways in glioblastoma


By analyzing gene expression data in gliobastoma in combination with
matched microRNA profiles, we have uncovered a post-transcriptional
regulation layer of surprising magnitude, comprising over 248,000
microRNA -mediated interactions. These include 7,000 genes whose
transcripts act as microRNA sponges and 148 genes that act through
alternative, non-sponge interactions. Biochemical analyses in cell lines
confirmed that this network regulates established drivers of tumor
initiation and subtype, including PTEN, PDGFRA, RB1, VEGFA, STAT3, and
RUNX1, suggesting that these interactions mediate crosstalk between
canonical oncogenic pathways. RNA silencing of 13 microRNA-mediated PTEN
regulators, whose locus deletions are predictive of PTEN expression
variability, was sufficient to downregulate PTEN in a 3 UTR-dependent
manner and to increase tumor-cell growth rates. Thus, this microRNA
-mediated network provides a mechanistic, experimentally validated
rationale for the loss of PTEN expression in a large number of glioma
samples with an intact PTEN locus.
