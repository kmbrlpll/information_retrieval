Title: Hydrogen bond surrogate (HBS) helices as orthosteric regulator of
hypoxia inducible transcription


Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric transcriptional
activator which plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and therefore is
an important therapeutic target. Transcriptional activation of HIF-1 is
known to involve the interaction between cysteine-histidine rich region1
(CH1) of a coactivator protein p300 or Creb Binding Protein (CBP) and
C-terminal activation domain (C-TAD) of its -subunit (HIF-1 C-TAD). Based
on the hydrogen bond surrogate (HBS) approach, we have rationally
designed stabilized alpha helix that can disrupt the binding interface
between C-TAD domain of HIF-1 and CH1 domain of p300/CBP. We have shown
by fluorescence polarization that such stabilized alpha helix mimetics
can directly bind to the CH1 domain of p300 and also can disrupt the
HIF-1/p300 complex. HBS helix mimetics are also shown to selectively
downregulate the hypoxia inducible genes in cell culture. Thus,
orthosteric inhibition of the HIF-1 transcriptional complex by rationally
designed helix mimetics offers a novel approach to downregulate the
expression of key hypoxia inducible genes responsible for tumor
progression.
