Title: A systematical view on key genetic factors affecting somatic copy
number alternations in different cancers


Along with somatic mutations and translocations, somatic copy number
alternations (SCNAs) play essential roles in the development of cancers.
However, it remains poorly understood what mutagenic features driving
cancer SCNAs are encoded in the genome sequence and how their effects
vary across different cancer types. Taking advantage of recently
available the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we performed a systematic
analysis on the effects of various genetic sequence features on cancer
SCNAs. We first assessed the correlations of breakpoint density across
different cancer types and found that they overall showed very strong
positive correlations, but in some cases, the correlations varied from
chromosome to chromosome. Next, we investigated the dependence of SCNAs
on 16 sequence features and found that compared to copy number variations
in human populations, SCNAs showed much weaker correlations, suggesting a
stronger effect of functional selection on their observed patterns.
Finally, we built integrative models to identify key features affecting
different cancer SCNAs. Our study provides a systematic view how
genome-wide sequence features affect cancer SCNAs and lays a foundation
for identifying key SCNAs driving cancer pathogenesis.
