Title: c-Myc suppresses DNA double-strand break repair


c-Myc is a potent oncogenic molecule that promotes tumorigenesis through
the induction of genomic instability. The exact mechanism(s) involved
remains to be elucidated. Here we discovered that -ray ionizing radiation
(IR)-induced double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) promote c-Myc to form foci
and to co-localize with -H2AX. Conditional expression of c-Myc in HO15.19
c-Myc-null cells using the Tet-Off/Tet-On inducible expression system
results in downregulation of Ku DNA binding and suppressed activities of
DNA-PKcs and DNA end-joining, leading to inhibition of DSB repair and
enhanced chromosomal and chromatid breaks. Expression of c-Myc reduces
both signal and coding joins with decreased fidelity during V(D)J
recombination. Mechanistically, c-Myc directly interacts with Ku 70
protein at the N-terminus via its MBII domain. Removal of the MBII domain
from c-Myc abrogates its inhibitory effects on Ku DNA binding, DNA-PKcs
and DNA end-joining activities, which results in loss of c-Myc's ability
to block DSB repair and V(D)J recombination. Interestingly, c-Myc
directly disrupts the Ku/DNA-PKcs complex in vitro and in vivo. Thus,
c-Myc suppression of DSB repair and V(D)J recombination may occur through
inhibition of the non-homologous end-joining pathway, which leads to
increased DNA damage, genetic instability and carcinogenesis.
