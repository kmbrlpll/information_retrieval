Title: IL-6 enhances migration and ICAM-1 expression of human oral
squamous cell carcinoma involves IL-6 receptor signaling pathway


Oral squamous cell carcinoma(SCC) has a striking tendency to migration
and metastasize. Interleukin-6(IL-6) has been implicated in the promotion
of many cancers proliferation and migration. Intercellular adhesion
molecule-1(ICAM-1), a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family, is
an inducible surface glycoprotein that mediates adhesion-dependent
cell-to-cell interactions. However, the effects of IL-6 in migration and
ICAM-1 expression in human oral cancer cells are largely unknown. We
found that IL-6 increased migration and ICAM-1 expression in human oral
cancer cells. Using a specific inhibitor and genetic inhibition of IL-6
receptor, we discovered that the IL-6 receptor is involved in migration
and ICAM-1 expression of human oral cancer cells. IL-6-mediated migration
and ICAM-1 up-regulation were attenuated by inhibitor of Syk, JNK and
AP-1. Activation of the Syk, JNK and AP-1 signaling pathway occurred
after IL-6 stimulation. IL-6 induced AP-1 activity was inhibited by Syk
and JNK inhibitor. Our results indicated that IL-6 enhances the migration
of human oral cancer cells by increasing ICAM-1 expression through the
IL-6 receptor, Syk, JNK and AP-1 signal transduction pathway.
