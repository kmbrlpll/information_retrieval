Title: Over expression of HGF accelerates hepatitis B virus-induced liver
carcinogenesis and hastens the malignancy of hepatocellular carcinoma


Genetically modified mouse models play important roles in improving our
understanding of HGF/MET signaling in liver development, regeneration and
in tumor formation. To evaluate the role of HGF/MET in HBV induced HCC,
we generated 1) alb-Cre-Metflox/flox mice which lack of MET expression in
the liver; 2) a mouse strain over-expressing human HGF (C3HHGF) to
determine if MET is required for HCC development and how HGF accelerates
HCC malignancy. We show here that overexpression of human HGF in a C3HHGF
mouse model induced spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Such
overexpression also accelerated hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen
expression in the liver, which in turn selectively promoted the growth of
Met-positive hepatocytes and ultimately led to hepatocellular
carcinogenesis. We also demonstrate here that HCC in C3HHGF mice
presented gene expression patterns highly associated with malignant human
HCC. Molecularly, the HCCs of C3HHGF mice had up-regulated VEGF/HGF
signal pathways that can be effectively inhibited by pathway inhibitors.
We conclude that C3HHGF mouse model can serve as a good tool for studying
human HCC, and we suggest that anti-angiogenic therapeutics can be
applied for the treatment of HGF-driven HCC.
