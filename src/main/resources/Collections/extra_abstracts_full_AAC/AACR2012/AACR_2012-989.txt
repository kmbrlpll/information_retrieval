Title: The crosstalk of mTOR/S6K1 and Hedgehog pathways


Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the most prevalent esophageal cancer
type in the United States, and TNF/mTOR pathway is known to mediate the
development of EAC. Additionally, aberrant activation of Gli1, downstream
effector of hedgehog pathway, has been observed in EAC. In this study, we
found that activated mTOR/S6K1 pathway promotes Gli1 transcriptional
activity and oncogenic function through S6K1-mediated Gli1
phosphorylation at Ser84, which releases Gli1 from its endogenous
inhibitor, SuFu. Moreover, elimination of S6K1 activation by mTOR pathway
inhibitor enhances the killing effects of the hedgehog pathway inhibitor.
Together, our results established a crosstalk between mTOR/S6K1 and the
hedgehog pathways, which provides not only a new mechanism for
non-canonical hedgehog pathway but also a rationale for combination
therapy for EAC.
