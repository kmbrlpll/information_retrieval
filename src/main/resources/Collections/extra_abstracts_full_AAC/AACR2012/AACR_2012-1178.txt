Title: Allele specific p53 mutant synthetic lethality


Rescuing the function of mutant p53 is an attractive cancer therapeutic
strategy. The NCI60 database has reported the growth inhibition of over
47,000 compounds in a panel of 60 human tumor cell lines with the p53
mutational status known. We hypothesized that we could use the NCI60
dataset as an in silico screen to identify compounds with activity in
cell lines containing mutant p53. We identified three compounds from the
thiosemicarbazone family and validated this methodology for two of the
three. Both compounds demonstrate a marked sensitivity in cell lines
carrying a p53-175 allele while at the same time are relatively nontoxic
to cells wildtype for p53. Mechanistic studies reveal that one of the
compounds restores a wildtype structure and function to the p53-175
mutant. These findings extend to p53R172H knock-in mutant mice as well as
to the inhibition of xenograft tumor growth in a 175-allele specific,
mutant p53 dependent manner. Together these data both validate a
bioinformatics approach to the identification of compounds with activity
in cell lines expressing mutant p53, and identify two compounds that
demonstrate allele specific mutant p53 synthetic lethality.
