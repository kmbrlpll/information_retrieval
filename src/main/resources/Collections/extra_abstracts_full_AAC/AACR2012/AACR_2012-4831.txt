Title: Treatment of brain inflammatory diseases by delivering exosome
encapsulated anti-inflammatory drugs from the nasal region to the brain


In this study, exosomes used to encapsulate curcumin (Exo-cur) or a Stat3
inhibitor, i.e., JSI124, (Exo-JSI124) were delivered non-invasively to
microglila cells via an intranasal route. The results generated from
three inflammation mediated disease models, i.e., a LPS induced brain
inflammation model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis and a GL26 brain
tumor model, showed that mice treated intranasally with Exo-cur or
Exo-JSI124 are protected from LPS induced brain inflammation, the
progression of MOG peptide induced EAE, and had significantly delayed
brain tumor growth in the GL26 tumor model. Intranasal administration of
Exo-cur or Exo-JSI124 led to rapid delivery of exosome encapsulated drug
to the brain that was selectively taken up by microglial cells, and
subsequently induced apoptosis of microglial cells. Our results
demonstrate that this strategy may provide a non-invasive and novel
therapeutic approach for treating brain inflammatory related diseases.
