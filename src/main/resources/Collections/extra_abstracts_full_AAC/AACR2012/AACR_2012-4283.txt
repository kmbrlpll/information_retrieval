Title: Cross-species hybridization of microarrays for studying tumor
transcriptome of brain metastasis


Although the importance of the cellular microenvironment (soil) during
invasion and metastasis of cancer cells (seed) has been well-recognized,
technical challenges have limited the ability to assess the influence of
the microenvironment on cancer cells at the molecular level. Here, we
show that an experimental strategy, competitive cross-species
hybridization of microarray experiments, can characterize the influence
of different microenvironments on cancer cells by independently
extracting gene expression data of cancer and host cells when human
cancer cells were xenografted into different organ sites of
immunocompromised mice. Surprisingly, the analysis of gene expression
data showed that the brain microenvironment induces complete
reprogramming of metastasized cancer cells, resulting in a gain of
neuronal cell characteristics and mimicking neurogenesis during
development. We also show that epigenetic changes coincide with
transcriptional reprogramming in cancer cells. These observations provide
proof of principle for competitive cross-species hybridization of
microarray experiments to characterize the effect of the microenvironment
on tumor cell behavior
