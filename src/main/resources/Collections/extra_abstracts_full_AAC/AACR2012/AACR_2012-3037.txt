Title: Cyr61/CCN1 regulates SHh through Notch signaling in pancreatic
cancer cells


Cyr61 (cysteine-rich 61)/CCN1, a member of the CCN family of growth
factors that includes CTGF, NOV, WISP-1, WISP-2 and WISP-3, is associated
with the development of various cancers. Our recent studies found
Cyr61/CCN1 play a critical role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through the
induction of EMT and stemness. Cyr61 mRNA and protein were detected in
the early precursor lesions and their expression intensified with disease
progression. However, the mode of action of CCN1 in the pancreatic
carcinogenesis is unknown. In this study, we have shown that CCN1
regulates the expression of Sonic hedgehog (SHh), a lipid-modified
secreted signaling protein, plays a critical role in pancreatic cancer
development from Pan1N lesions to invasive growth of the disease.
Moreover, we also found that SHh regulation by CCN1in pancreatic cancer
cells is mediated through the regulation Notch1 signaling pathway. These
extensive studies proposed that targeting Cyr61/CCN1 can provide a new
treatment option for patients with pancreatic cancer as blocking CCN1
simultaneously two critical pathways (i.e., SHh and Notch1) associated
with the development of the disease as well as drug resistence. (THIS
