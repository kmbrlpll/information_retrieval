Title: Advancing pathway analysis using bioluminescent reporters


To enable investigation of key cellular signaling pathways, Promega has
developed a portfolio of bioluminescent reporter gene assays using
Firefly and Renilla luciferases. In combination with best-in-class
luciferase detection reagents, these genetic reporter systems enable
interrogation of important cellular responses involved in cancer,
inflammation, and CNS disease. To address specialized customer needs in
our industrial and research markets, Promega has a new custom assay
service team dedicated to applying these enabling technologies through
strategic external research collaborations. The performance of this
technology portfolio is presented, including novel applications of
luciferase reporters to interrogation of cytokine, stress, and toxicity
pathway responses.
