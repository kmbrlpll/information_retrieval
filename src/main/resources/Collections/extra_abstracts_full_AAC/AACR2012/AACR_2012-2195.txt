Title: Smurf2 is a novel tumor suppressor gene that governs chromatin
structure and genome integrity through RNF20


Cancers are known to harbour alterations in chromatin landscape in
addition to allelic mutations. Here, we show that genomic ablation of
Smurf2, a HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, results in dysregulation of
global gene expression, altered DNA damage response, and unstable
genomes, which culminate to increased susceptibility to various types of
cancers in aged mice. We demonstrate that Smurf2 regulates histone H2B
monoubiquitination as well as histone H3 tri-methylation at K4 and K79 by
targeting RNF20, the major E3 ligase for histone H2B ubiquitination, to
proteasomal degradation. We further show that Smurf2 and RNF20 are
co-localized at the -H2AX foci of double-stranded DNA breaks in the
nucleus, and Smurf2 regulates RNF20 stability in human cancer cells.
Thus, our data indicate that Smurf2 has a tumor suppression function that
normally maintains genomic stability by controlling the epigenetic
landscape of histone modifications through RNF20.
