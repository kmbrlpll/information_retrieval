Title: Determining the functional roles of the specific isoforms of
ARID3B from cellular localizations


Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from a gynecological
malignancy in the United States, yet the genetic mechanisms that
contribute to ovarian cancer progression are poorly understood. We have
determined that ARID3B, a member of the AT-rich interaction domain (ARID)
family of proteins, is overexpressed in ovarian cancer. Therefore, we
want to assess if ARID3B plays an important role in ovarian cancer
progression. We have demonstrated that there are two ARID3B isoforms: the
long form (ARID3BFL at 61kDa) and the short form (ARID3Bsh at 28kDa). We
show that the ARID3BFL is mostly found in the nucleus and some is found
in the membrane of cells. Furthermore, the short isoform of ARID3B (when
overexpressed) is primarily found in cytoplasmic and
membrane/mitochondria fractions. Therefore, we hypothesize that by virtue
of these unique cellular distributions that ARID3B isoforms elicit
different cellular responses. ARID3BFL binds DNA and induces apoptosis in
ovarian cancer cell lines while ARID3Bsh does not induce cell death.
Further elucidation of the roles of the two ARID3B isoforms will help us
understand ovarian cancer progression, cellular response to chemotherapy,
and develop prognostic markers and targeted therapies.
