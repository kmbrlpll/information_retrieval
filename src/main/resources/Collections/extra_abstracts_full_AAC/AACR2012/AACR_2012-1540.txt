Title: Inhibition of SDF production by brain tumor cells reduces brain
tumor bed effect


Previous study on a murine prostate tumor model, TRAMP-C1, has shown that
tumor transplants in preirradiated (pre-IR) tissues have longer growth
delay and lower microvascular density (MVD) than in nonirradiated
tissues, a phenomenon known as the tumor bed effect (TBE) that is
associated with less responsive to salvage radiotherapy or chemotherapy
and higher risk of metastasis. This study further demonstrates that a
murine astrocytoma, ALTS1C1, grown from pre-IR brain tissues also have
obvious TBE. This indicates that there is also a brain TBE that may
affect the therapeutic efficacy of recurrent brain tumor after
radiotherapy. Additional study shows that the inhibition of SDF
expression in ALTS1C1 by specific siRNA reduces pre-IR-induced tumor
growth delay and TAM association with hypoxia. The vessel formation
mechanism is also altered into more mature form. This indicates that SDF
production by brain tumor cells plays significant roles on the response
of recurrent brain tumors after radiotherapy to salvage therapy.
