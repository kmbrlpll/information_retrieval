Title: NEK6 promotes JB6 C141 cell transformation and activates STAT3
through its phosphorylation on Ser727


NEK6 (NIMA-related kinase 6) is a homologue of the Aspergillus nidulans
protein NIMA (never in mitosis, gene A). We demonstrate that ectopic
expression of NEK6 induces anchorage-independent transformation of JB6
Cl41 mouse epidermal cells. Tissue arrays and Western immunoblot analysis
show that NEK6 is overexpressed in malignant tissues and several cancer
cell lines. We also discovered that NEK6 interacts with STAT3, an
oncogenic transcription factor, and phosphorylates STAT3 on Ser(727),
which is important for transcriptional activation. Additional studies
using NEK6 mutants suggested that the phosphorylation on both Ser(206)
and Thr(210) of NEK6 is critical for STAT3 phosphorylation and
anchorage-independent transformation of mouse epidermal cells. Notably,
knockdown of NEK6 decreased colony formation and STAT3 Ser(727)
phosphorylation. Based on our findings, the most likely mechanism that
can account for this biological effect involves the activation of STAT3
through the phosphorylation on Ser(727). Because of the critical role
that STAT3 plays in mediating oncogenesis, the stimulatory effects of
NEK6 on STAT3 and cell transformation suggest that this family of
serine/threonine kinases might represent a novel chemotherapeutic target.
