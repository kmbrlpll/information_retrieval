Title: Detection of rare mutations in plasma by droplet digital PCR


Detection and quantitation of specific mutations in circulating plasma
holds promise for earlier and less invasive diagnosis of disease. This
presents significant analytical challenges, particularly as the biomarker
may differ from its highly abundant wildtype by only a single nucleotide.
Conventional methods have poor selectivity and fail to detect mutant
sequence below 1 in 100 wildtype sequences. Compounding this, the amount
of circulating nucleic acid in plasma is low. Here we present a simple
strategy using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for the detection of somatic
mutations with high selectivity and sensitivity. Based on the simple
principle of sample partitioning into water-in-oil microdroplets, this
ddPCR method increases the abundance of a mutant DNA sequence up to
20,000 times compared to an equivalent bulk PCR reaction. Using
conventional TaqMan chemistries and workflow, selectivities of up to
1/100,000 can readily be achieved in any laboratory. We evaluated ddPCR
for the detection and quantitation of several clinically important
mutations in the EGFR and KRAS loci from clinical samples derived from
normal and tumor plasma samples. We also demonstrate the feasibility of
multiplexing of Kras and EGFR assays to improve sample processing
efficiency.
