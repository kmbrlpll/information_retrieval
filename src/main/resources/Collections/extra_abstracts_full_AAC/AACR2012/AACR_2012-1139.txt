Title: Novel, cellular active inhibitors of G6PD, a key mediator of
ROS-induced cellular stress


Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the rate-limiting enzyme in
the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and catalyses the oxidation of
glucose-6-phosphate to glucono--lactone-6-phosphate with the concomitant
production of NADPH. Alongside an important role in the production of
biosynthetic precursors such as ribonucleotides, this pathway is a major
cellular source of NADPH. As such, the pathway plays a critical role in
both the biosynthesis of fatty acids & cholesterol biosynthesis (thus
supporting cell division) and maintaining glutathione in its reduced
state (GSH), the latter ameliorating cellular stress arising from
reactive oxygen species (ROS). Given these key roles, modulation of the
pathway has potential therapeutic application, and inhibition of G6PD is
an attractive target, particularly in combination with standard of care
radiotherapy or cytotoxic drugs which can increase ROS. We have developed
a series of novel steroid G6PD inhibitors which, in our hands, modulate
flux through the PPP and increase ROS-induced stress in cells. This
disclosure will describe some of our results in this area.
