Title: Control of cellular proliferation by ERK: A quantitative analysis
in single cells


The EGF-stimulated ERK/MAPK system is a key conduit for physiological
growth signals. We have used a combination of live and fixed single-cell
measurements to determine the quantitative operating principles of this
pathway under long-term stimulation by physiological levels of EGF,
revealing three essential properties of the network. First, the
extracellular concentration of EGF is encoded, at different points in the
network, by distinct frequency- and amplitude-modulated responses.
Second, control of cellular proliferation is controlled predominantly by
the lower end of the pathway's dynamic range, necessitating nearly
complete inhibition of the pathway to elicit growth arrest. Third, the
diverse phenotypic outputs of the pathway are controlled by different
segments of the overall dynamic range, with distinct molecular targets
engaged at different thresholds. These properties have direct relevance
to strategies for therapeutic inhibition of the ERK/MAPK network.
