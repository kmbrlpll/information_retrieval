Title: Tumor cell entry into the lymph node is controlled by CCL1
chemokine expressed by lymph node lymphatic sinuses


The lymphatic vessels are thought to contribute to metastasis primarily
by serving as a transportation system. It is widely believed that tumor
cells enter lymph nodes passively, by the flow of lymph. Here, we
demonstrate that lymph node lymphatic sinuses control tumor cell entry
into the lymph node. In vitro, tumor migration to lymphatic endothelium
(LECs) was inhibited by blocking CCR8 or CCL1. Recombinant CCL1 promoted
migration of CCR8+ tumor cells. Pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-, IL-1 and
LPS increased CCL1 production by LECs as well as tumor cell migration to
LECs. Blocking studies showed that CCL1 is a key molecule mediating tumor
cell chemotaxis to inflamed lymphatic endothelium. In mouse and human
tissues CCL1 protein was detected in lymph node lymphatic sinuses, but
not in the peripheral lymphatics. In addition, CCR8 was strongly
expressed by human malignant melanoma. In a mouse model, blocking CCR8
function decreased lymph node metastasis. Notably, inhibition of CCR8 led
to the arrest of tumor cells in the collecting lymphatic vessels at the
junction with the lymph node subcapsular sinus. These data identify a
novel function for CCL1/CCR8 in metastasis and lymph node LECs as a
critical check-point for entry of metastases into the lymph nodes.
