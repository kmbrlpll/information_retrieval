Title: Histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) target identification and mechanism
of action of HDAC8 isoform-specific inhibitors


HDAC8 is a member of the histone deacetylase family, but no acetylation
target in cells has yet been identified. Due to a different pocket
structure, most of the pan-HDAC inhibitors currently in the clinic bind
poorly to it. HDAC8 knockout mice were shown to have an embryonic defect
in neural crest development, but the adult mice have no other published
phenotype, and its functions in adult normal or tumor cells are not well
understood. In this work, we have undertaken extensive cellular and
tissue localization studies, knockdown and isoform-specific inhibition
studies, whole genome expression profiling, proteomics experiments to
identify differentially acetylated and expressed proteins, and kinome
siRNA knockdown experiments to identify pathways of activity. In total,
these results point to HDAC8's essential function in many tumor cell
types, not all of which are dependent upon the enzymatic activity of the
enzyme.
