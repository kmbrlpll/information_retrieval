Title: DEPTOR, an mTOR inhibitor, is a novel substrate of SCFTrCP E3
ubiquitin ligase upon S6K1/RSK1 phosphorylation and regulates survival
and autophagy


DEPTOR, an inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2, is degraded via
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by an unknown E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here we
report that DEPTOR is a physiological substrate of SCFTrCP E3 ligase for
targeted degradation. Upon growth factor stimulation, RSK1 and S6K1
kinases are activated to phosphorylate DEPTOR, which is then recognized
by the F-box protein, TrCP via its degron sequence for subsequent
ubiquitination and degradation by SCF E3. Endogenous DEPTOR levels are
negatively regulated by TrCP; being decreased or increased upon TrCP
overexpression or knockdown, respectively. DEPTOR half-life is shortened
by TrCP but extended by its dominant negative mutant, by RSK1/S6K1
inhibition, or upon TrCP degron site mutations. Biologically, DEPTOR,
accumulated upon TrCP knockdown, inactivates mTORC1 and activates AKT in
cancer cells to confer resistance to rapamycin and paclitaxel.
Furthermore, DEPTOR, accumulated upon glucose deprivation and mTOR
inhibition, induces autophagy. Thus, TrCP-DEPTOR-mTOR intertwines to
regulate cell survival and autophagy.
