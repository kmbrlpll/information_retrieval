Title: OOPs: Novel HIF-1 mimics


Alpha subunit of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is an important
transcriptional regulator of hypoxia-inducible genes responsible for
tumor proliferation and metastasis, and therefore HIF-1 is a valuable
therapeutic target. In turn, the interaction between C-terminal
activation domain (C-TAD) of HIF-1 and the cysteine-histidine rich domain
(CH1) of its coactivator p300 is known to play the key role in the HIF-1
pathway. However, to date very few compounds have been reported to
disrupt HIF-1/p300 complex. We have rationally designed and synthesized
non-peptidic mimics of HIF-1 CTAD A-helix with novel oligooxopiperazine
backbone (OOPs). These mimics exhibit relatively low toxicity and
substantially downregulate expression levels of selected
hypoxia-inducible genes (VEGF, c-MET, LOX, GLUT1, CXCR4) in cellulo in a
dose-dependent manner.
