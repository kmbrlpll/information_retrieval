Title: VEGF receptor-3 interacts with PI3K directly to regulate
lymphangiogenesis


Dissemination of malignant cells into the regional lymph nodes is a
common occurrence in many cancers. The vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) family is a major regulator spread of cancer to lymph nodes via
induction of lymphangiogenesis. We have used primary lymphatic
endothelial cells and clinical material to investigate VEGF-C/VEGF
receptor (VEGFR)-3 signalling pathways. We found that treatment with
VEGF-C induced activation of PI3K/Akt and MEK/Erk in lymphatic
endothelial cells. Furthermore, activation of PI3K/Akt by VEGF-C/VEGFR-3
resulted in phosphorylation of P70S6K, eNOS, PLC1, and Erk1/2.
Importantly, a direct interaction between PI3K and VEGFR-3 in lymphatic
endothelial cells was demonstrated both in vitro and in clinical
specimens, where it was associated with the presence of lymph node
metastases in small cell carcinoma of the lung. Blocking PI3K abolished
VEGF-C-stimulated lymphatic endothelial cell tube formation and
migration. Our findings demonstrate that specific VEGFR-3 signalling
pathways are activated in lymphatic endothelial cells by VEGF-C. The
importance of PI3K in VEGF-C/VEGFR-3-mediated lymphangiogenesis provides
a potential therapeutic target for tumor lymphatic metastasis.
