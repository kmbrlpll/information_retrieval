Title: Interaction of proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) with
c-Abl in cell proliferation and response to DNA damages in breast cancer


Cell proliferation in primary and metastatic tumors is a fundamental
characteristic of advanced breast cancer. Further understanding of the
mechanism underlying enhanced cell growth will be important in
identifying novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. Here we
demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of the proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a critical event in growth regulation of breast
cancer cells. We found that phosphorylation of PCNA at tyrosine 211
(Y211) enhanced its association with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase
c-Abl. We further demonstrated that c-Abl facilitates chromatin
association of PCNA and is required for nuclear foci formation of PCNA in
cells stressed by DNA damage as well as in unperturbed cells. Targeting
Y211 phosphorylation of PCNA with a cell-permeable peptide inhibited the
phosphorylation and reduced the PCNA-Abl interaction. These results show
that PCNA signal transduction has an important impact on the growth
regulation of breast cancer cells.
