Title: Inhibition of autophagy and tumor growth in colon cancer by miR-502


Autophagy is a catabolic process that allows cellular macromolecules to
be broken down and recycled as metabolic precursors. The influence of
non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) in autophagy has not been explored in colon
cancer. In this study, we discovered a novel mechanism of autophagy
regulated by hsa-miR-502-5p (miR-502) by suppression of Rab1B, a critical
mediator of autophagy. A number of other miR-502 suppressed mRNA targets
(e.g. DHODH) were also identified by microarray analysis. Ectopic
expression of miR-502 inhibited autophagy, colon cancer cell growth, and
cell cycle progression of colon cancer cells in vitro. miR-502 also
inhibited in vivo colon cancer growth in a mouse tumor xenografts model.
In addition, the expression of miR-502 was regulated by p53 via a
negative feedback regulatory mechanism. The expression of miR-502 was
down-regulated in colon cancer patient specimens compared to the paired
normal control samples. These results suggest that miR-502 may function
as a potential tumor suppressor and therefore be a novel candidate for
developing miR-502 based therapeutic strategies.
