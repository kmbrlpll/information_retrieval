Title: Rapid mass spectrometric profiling of blood sera detects cancer
with high accuracy


Cancer diagnosis is problematic because the disease is often asymptomatic
at early stages of progression and/or recurrence. We report here the
integration of a mass spectrometric metabolic profiling procedure coupled
with a support vector machine computational method for use in early
cancer diagnostics, and describe successful application of the method to
ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers.
