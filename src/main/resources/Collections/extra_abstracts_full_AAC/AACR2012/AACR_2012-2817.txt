Title: Preclinical studies of the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors in
endometrial cancer cell lines


The PI3K pathway plays a pivotal role in many cellular functions that
include regulation of cell proliferation, survival, growth, angiogenesis,
and motility. Dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is a common
occurrence in cancer and could be a result of mutations in PIK3CA and
PTEN, as well as loss of heterozygosity of PTEN. In endometrial cancer
patients, the most frequent aberration is the activation of the PI3K/mAKT
pathway with; (1) 80% loss of PTEN function and 30% PIK3CA mutations in
type I endometrial cancer and (2) 20% PIK3CA mutation and 46% PIK3CA
amplification in type II endometrial cancer. In this study, we
investigated the functional consequences of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
PF-04691502 and PF-05212384 in endometrial cancer cell lines for
antiproliferative effects, pathway signaling inhibition and tumor growth
inhibition. Both compounds had antiproliferative activity in vitro that
translated to tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Moreover, in the MFE-280
xenograft model that harbors a PIK3CA mutation (P1047R), the dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors showed tumor regression. These studies support the
use of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors for endometrial cancer.
