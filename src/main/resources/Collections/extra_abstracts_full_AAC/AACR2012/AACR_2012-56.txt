Title: Stromal fibroblasts in the microenvironment of gastric carcinomas
promote tumor metastasis through upregulated TAGLN expression


Fibroblasts play a significant role in tumorigenesis, tumor progression
and metastasis, but their detailed molecular characteristics and clinical
significance are unclear. TAGLN is an actin-binding protein played an
important role in tumorigenesis. Here, we aimed to the interaction
between cancer cells and their microenvironments to study how the
fibroblasts isolated from human gastric carcinomas facilitate
tumorigenesis through TAGLN. Gene expression profiling and real-time PCR
and Western blot in gastric carcinoma samples indicated that TAGLN
expression was up-regulated in gastric carcinoma. However, further
investigation by IHC shown that TAGLN was expressed in tumor stoma, not
in tumor cells. TAGLN expression was promoted mutually by fibroblasts and
MKN-45 co-culture. Decreased expression of TAGLN suggested that
carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) can enhance tumor metastasis
through upregulated TAGLN by MMP-2 and the FAK pathway.
