Title: Understanding cancer invasion by the systems biological analysis
of collective cell migration in 3D tissue models


Collective migration is essential for morphogenesis and wound repair in
healthy tissue as well as for tissue invasion in cancer. In such
migration cells move in supracellular, cadherin mediated units opposed to
isolated ameoboid or mesenchymal movements. Understanding collective
migration in healthy epithelia is a prerequisite for dissecting and
analyzing invasion in carcinoma. We have set up a novel, easily
reproducible 3D in vitro wound model of epidermal regeneration. The model
is based on commercial tissue cultures and can thus be reproducibly
manufactured in larger quantities. We used our model for a systematic
analysis of wound reepithelialization by measuring cytokines and mRNA
expression. Using virtual microscopy we could quantitatively capture the
cellular intra-tissue streams during reepithelialization. We integrated
our data in a systems biological multi-scale model. Our results uncover a
sequence of different types of collective epithelial migration which
occur during wound healing in an orchestrated manner. In cancer invasion
these mechanisms are hijacked by the tumor in an emergent malignant
exploit of the intrinsically healthy processes of epithelial
morphogenesis and repair.
