Title: Regulation of DNA repair by Kruppel-like factor 8


Krppel-like factor 8 (KLF8) regulates critical gene transcription and
cellular events associated with cancer. Recently we have identified
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1(PARP-1) as a novel KLF8-interacting and
regulating protein. However, whether KLF8 is involved in PARP-1 relulated
DNA repair is unknown. Here, we report that KLF8 plays a role in the
PARP-1-dependent DNA repair. Western blotting and immunofluorescence
staining indicated that overexpression of KLF8 attenuated the H2A.X
levels in doxorubicin-treated PARP-1+/+ MEF cells but not in the PARP-1/
MEF cells, whereas the PARP-1-interaction-defective KLF8 mutant did not
affect the H2A.X levels. Clonogenic assay and tetrazolium salt (WST-1)
assay showed that KLF8 promoted cell survival in human breast cancer
cells. Comet assay revealed that KLF8 expression could decrease DNA
damage levels. Interestingly, we found that in response to DNA damage
KLF8 was phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs and subsequently sumoylated, which
depended on the interaction between KLF8 and PARP-1. These results
suggest a novel role and mechanism for KLF8 in the regulation of DNA
repair in cancer cells.
