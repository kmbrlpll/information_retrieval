Title: Nuclear PRAS40 regulates the cellular response to nucleolar stress


The Proline-rich Akt Substrate of 40kDA (PRAS40) has recently been
identified as a binding partner and inhibitor of the mammalian Target of
Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1), a growth factor- and nutrient-sensitive
kinase whose activity promotes protein synthesis and cell growth. Despite
its inhibitory effect on mTORC1, PRAS40 has been shown to promote cell
survival in rodent models of spinal cord injury and tumorigenesis.
Importantly, PRAS40 levels have also been found to correlate with poor
prognosis in lung cancer patients, an effect not readily explained by
mTORC1 inhibition. Here we demonstrate that in addition to its known
cytoplasmic role in inhibiting mTORC1, PRAS40 also actively shuttles to
the nucleus, where it congregates at the periphery of nucleoli and exists
in a high-molecular weight complex void of mTORC1 components. Through
immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses we have begun to
identify members of this nuclear PRAS40 complex. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that PRAS40 overexpression attenuates Actinomycin D-mediated
induction of nucleolar stress markers. These findings may help to explain
the apparent pro-tumorigenic effects of PRAS40 and identify the PRAS40
nuclear complex as a potential target for anti-cancer drug discovery.
