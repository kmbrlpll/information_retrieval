Title: A glimpse into the somatic mutation landscape of melanoma through
exome sequencing of 121 tumor-normal pairs


Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer of melanocytic origin characterized
by high metastatic potential and mutation rate. Affording a survey of the
wide breadth of genomic lesions found in melanoma, we present here an
analysis of the somatic mutations discovered in the sequenced exomes of
121 melanoma tumor-normal pairs. We identify frequent genomic alterations
both in genes previously implicated in melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, TP53,
CDKN2A, PTEN) as well as in several genes whose role in melanoma
tumorigenesis has not yet been established and thus are of particular
interest. To do so we implement a novel method to increase the
identification of genes that are significantly recurrently mutated in
melanoma in the setting of its exceptionally high mutation rate. A
preponderance of C>T transitions (85%) in the observed mutational profile
reflects a history of DNA damage due to UV radiation, though the majority
of somatic mutations in known melanoma genes are not C>T events. Our
study broadens understanding of the genomic lesions involved in melanoma
tumorigenesis, and we expect our analysis approach to inform future
genomic studies of cancer lineages with similarly high mutation rates.
