Title: Characterization of a p53 knockout Sprague Dawley rat


The tumor suppressor protein TP53 plays a crucial role in cancer biology,
and the Tp53 gene is the most mutated gene in human cancer. The Tp53
knockout mouse models have been widely used in cancer etiology studies
and in search for a cure of cancer with some limitations that other model
organisms might help overcome. Via pronuclear microinjection of Zinc
Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), we created a Tp53 knockout rat that contains an
11 bp deletion in exon 3. This deletion produces a frameshift and
premature stop codons in the open reading frame. In cohorts of 30
homozygous, 35 heterozygous and 25 wild type rats, the homozygotes have
an average life span of 126 days, and half of heterozygotes died by a
year of age. Both heterozygous and homozygous knockouts developed a wide
spectrum of tumors, most commonly, sarcomas. However, there is a
strikingly high incidence of brain lesions, especially in homozygous
animals. In addition, unlike the Tp53 knockout mice, both male and female
homozygous Tp53 knockout rats are fertile. We believe this knockout rat
line will be useful in studying cancer types rarely observed in mice and
in carcinogenicity assays for drug development.
