Title: A precise orthotopic rectal tumor model for evaluating therapeutic
response of cancer treatment


We have previously reported a true orthotopic rectal model in which
tumors start forming in the rectal mucosal tissue from which tumors
actually arise. The model was generated by intrarectal transplantation of
mouse rectal cancer cells stably expressing fluorescent protein, followed
by disrupting the epithelial cell layer of the rectal mucosa by soaking
with an acetic acid solution. Early stage tumor was detected on the
rectal mucosa from as early as 6 days after transplantation, which then
became invasive into the submucosal tissue. The tumor incidence on the
rectal mucosa was 100%, and it was proved that this rectal tumor model
reflects the natural course of rectal cancer accurately. Spontaneous
lymph node metastasis and lung metastasis were observed 4 weeks after
transplantation in over 90% of mice. In the present study, we will report
whether this model is useful for evaluating therapeutic response of
surgical local resection of tumor with combination of anticancer drugs
such as a telomerase-specific replicating adenovirus designed for cancer
therapy.
