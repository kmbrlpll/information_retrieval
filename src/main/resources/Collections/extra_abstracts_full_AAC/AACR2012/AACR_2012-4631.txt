Title: Anti-CD70 antibody-drug conjugates containing
pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers demonstrate robust antitumor activity


Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent an important approach for the
selective delivery of highly potent small molecules to malignant cells.
Recently, we have adapted the highly cytotoxic class of minor groove DNA
crosslinking agents, pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers (PBDs), in order to
conjugate them to monoclonal antibodies. These totally synthetic
molecules alkylate guanine bases in a sequence-specific manner to cause
cell death at pM concentrations. In this report, we describe for the
first time a novel PBD that can be stably conjugated to the anti-CD70
monoclonal antibody (mAb) h1F6 via maleimide conjugation to engineered
cysteine residues created by the single amino acid substitution S239C on
each heavy chain. This results in a uniform loading of two drugs per
antibody. The resulting ADC binds selectively to CD70 on renal cell
carcinoma cell lines and releases the free drug upon internalization and
cleavage of the dipeptide linker in the lysosome. The ADC retains the
robust cytotoxicity of the free drug, displaying immunologically
selective antitumor activity in xenograft models at well tolerated doses
as low as 0.1 mg/kg. The PBDs represent a promising new class of cancer
drugs for targeted delivery.
