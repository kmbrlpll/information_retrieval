Title: Genetic ancestry distribution in basal-cell carcinoma cases and
controls from Puerto Rico


Introduction: The incidence and clinical presentation of Basal-cell
carcinoma (BCC) vary among different ethnic subgroups. In the Hispanic
population of Puerto Rico, the contribution of genetic ancestral factors
in determining BCC risk and its clinical presentation is unknown.
Methods: The study population consists of 83 BCC skin cancer cases and 89
controls recruited from a private dermatology practice in Ponce, Puerto
Rico. A panel of 106 ancestry informative markers was genotyped using
iPLEX Sequenom technology. Individual genetic ancestry was estimated
using a maximum likelihood approach. The distribution of genetic ancestry
was compared between cases and controls. Results: The distribution of
genetic ancestry among the 172 study subjects varied from 0 to 89%
African, 11 to 99% European, and 0 to 70% Native American. There was no
significant difference in the average European (p= 0.891), African (p=
0.44) and Native American (p= 0.232) ancestry proportions between BCC
cases and controls. Conclusions: Global genetic ancestry does not seem to
contribute significantly to the risk of BCC in the Puerto Rican
population.
