Title: GFP imaging of DNA repair after UV irradiation of cancer cells


The ability to image DNA repair in cancer cells after irradiation as well
as its inhibition by potential therapeutic agents is important for the
further development of radiotherapy of cancer. The relocalization of GFP
fused to the chromatin-binding domain of a check-point-adapter protein
53BP1 was imaged after UV irradiation of breast cancer and MiaPaca-2
human pancreatic cancer cells. 53BP1 is a DNA repair protein that is
over-expressed when double-stranded breaks occur in DNA. During live-cell
imaging, 53BP1-GFP foci formation was observed within 15 minutes after UV
irradiation. Most 53BP1 foci resolved by 90 min. To block UV-induced
double stranded break (DSB) repair in cancer cells, we targeted poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) with ABT-888 (veliparib). PAPR inhibition
markedly enhanced UV-irradiation-induced foci persistence, even more than
90 min after UV irradiation, and decreased cell proliferation of breast
and pancreatic cancer cells. The results suggest UV-irradiation and PAPR
inhibition are a promising therapeutic combination for breast and
pancreatic cancer.
