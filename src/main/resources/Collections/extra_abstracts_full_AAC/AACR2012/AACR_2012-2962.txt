Title: FOXM1 mediates Dox resistance in breast cancer by enhancing DNA
repair


Transcription factors (TFs) are direct effectors of altered signaling
pathways in cancer. To uncover new TFs that would determine clinical
outcomes in breast cancer patients, we systematically analyzed gene
expression data from breast cancer patients. Our results revealed that
forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) is the top-ranked survival-associated TF
with triple-negative breast cancer. Surprisingly, silencing FOXM1
expression led breast cancer cells to become more sensitive to
doxorubicin (Dox). We found that FOXM1-dependent resistance to Dox is
mediated by regulating DNA repair genes. We further demonstrated that
NF-B1 interacts with FOXM1 in the presence of Dox to protect breast
cancer cells from DNA damage. Finally, silencing FOXM1 expression in a
mouse xenograft model significantly sensitized the cells to Dox. Our
systematic approaches identified an unexpected role of FOXM1 in Dox
resistance by regulating DNA repair genes and FOXM1 may be a promising
therapeutic target for sensitizing breast cancer cells to Dox.
