Title: Antifolates as folate receptor targeting ligands: Design and
synthesis of their conjugates with cytotoxic agents


Antifolates are interfering specifically with DNA synthesis in the
S-phase of the cell cycle. Thus, they are cytotoxic to rapidly dividing
cancer cells, which replicate their DNA more frequently. Some antifolates
bind with high affinity to the cell-membrane-associated folate receptor
(FR). FR is frequently over-expressed in some of the most prevalent
tumors. FR-binding antifolates can also be used as ligands for
FR-targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. With this presentation we are
reporting an improved synthesis of the FR-binding antifolate CB3717.
Furthermore, to demonstrate its dual utility as FR-ligand and therapeutic
agent, we designed and synthesized a conjugate of CB3717 with the highly
cytotoxic agent Desacetylvinblastine Monohydrazide. A hydrophilic spacer
unit and two biologically releasable disulfide-based linker systems were
used to construct the conjugate. This conjugate exhibited high binding
affinity for FR and excellent anti-tumor activity in vivo (subcutaneous
FR+ KB tumors).
