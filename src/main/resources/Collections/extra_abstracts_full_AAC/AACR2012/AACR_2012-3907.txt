Title: Discovery and characterization of AZ285 as a potent and selective
inhibitor of CK2 kinase


Casein Kinase 2 (CK2) is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed
serine/threonine kinase that regulates several key oncogenic signaling
pathways, including PI3K/AKT, and NFkB and Wnt, and whose targeted
overexpression in transgenic animal models results in neoplastic growth.
Herein we describe the identification of AZ285, a potent
pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-derived inhibitor of CK2 with a high degree of
kinase selectivity. AZ285 depletes levels of the CK2 substrates pAKTS129
and PTENS370 and induces apoptosis in cells in a concentration-dependent
manner. Optimization of early leads was aided in part by cell wash-out
experiments and X-ray cocrystallography with huCK2a and resulted in an
agent with physical properties and DMPK characteristics suitable for
evaluation in disease model studies.
