Title: Aneuploidy-driven clonal diversification underlies tumor phenotype
switching


The acquisition of an invasive phenotype and its reversion to a
proliferative phenotype are crucial steps in tumor metastases. We have
been able to reproduce these steps through a combination of in vitro and
in vivo methods. We show that proliferative subclones isolated from human
carcinoma cells can generate invasive subclones in vitro, which is
associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover,
the invasive mesenchymal clones can reverse their phenotype (MET) through
tumorigenesis in vivo. Phenotypic switching occurs with changes in
karyotypes, which dictate changes in the chromosome transcriptome and in
the expression of genes that account for the phenotypic switching. We
conclude that chromosome instability generates the transcriptome
diversity, which in the appropriate environment leads to the expansion of
clonal variants responsible for malignant progression.
