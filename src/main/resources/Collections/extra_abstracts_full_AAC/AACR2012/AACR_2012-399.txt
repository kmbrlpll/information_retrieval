Title: Deletion of the Mint3 gene in mice abrogates macrophage functions
and increases resistance to cancer metastasis


Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is the master transcription factor to
shift the energy production system from oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) to glycolysis during hypoxia. Although most cells employ OXPHOS
for ATP during normoxia, macrophage is unique in using glycolysis
constitutively. We have proposed that macrophages use Mint3 to inhibit
FIH-1 that suppresses transcriptional activity of HIF-1 during normoxia.
To demonstrate physiological function of Mint3 in macrophages, we
establish Mint3 deficient mice and analyze macrophage specific functions.
The mutant mice have no apparent phenotype but exhibit significant
resistance against lipopolysaccaride (LPS)-induced septic shock and
cancer metastasis. Macrophages obtained from the mutant mice exhibit 60%
levels of ATP content compared to wild type cells, lower levels of
glycolysis, cytokine production and motility. Thus, cell type specific
role of Mint3 in energy production in macrophages is demonstrated for the
first time using genetically manipulated mice. Specific function of Mint3
in macrophages might allow us developing therapeutics to regulate
excessive macrophage functions during infection and diseases such as
cancer.
