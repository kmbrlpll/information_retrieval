Title: Rational design of small molecule inhibitors that bind to an
allosteric pocket on human heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)


The 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) plays an important role in cancer
and its pharmacological modulation with small molecules may represent a
useful therapeutic approach. The discovery of such agents has been
hampered by the lack of a full length crystal structure of human Hsp70.
We constructed a homology model of the human Hsp70, which we investigated
for potential druggable sites using SiteMap tool. An allosteric site in
the nucleotide binding domain was identified and used to design potent
Hsp70 modulators. Analysis of the Glide docking resulted in an
understanding of important interactions between designed ligands, such as
YK5, and the Hsp70 protein. When tested in breast cancer cells, YK5 led
to depletion of onco-proteins, induced apoptosis and inhibited growth.
YK5 is to our knowledge the first rationally designed small molecule
inhibitor of Hsp70, and thus, represents a novel chemical tool to
investigate its potential in cancer and other diseases.
