Title: Hypoxia induces BACH1 expression regulating colon cancer metastasis


BACH1 (BTB and CNC homology 1) is a basic region-leucine zipper (bZip)
transcription factor that binds to MAREs (Maf recognition elements) and
acts as a repressor of genes that regulate the oxidative stress response.
It has been reported that BACH1 is a novel let-7 target and regulates
breast cancer metastasis. Here we show that hypoxia induces BACH1
expression by regulating BACH1 promoter activity. In a mouse xenograft
model, BACH1 depletion reduces the primary tumor growth of HCT-116
colorectal cancer cells. In addition, knockdown of BACH1 significantly
decreases the invasive efficiency of colorectal cancer cells. Finally, we
confirm that BACH1 expression is high in the patient samples of
colorectal cancer and metastasis, unlike normal colon tissues. These
results suggest BACH1 as a novel target for cancer therapeutic strategy.
