Title: Development of potent SHP2 inhibitors for in vivo studies


The Src homology-2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2
(SHP2) is a positive transducer of growth factor, cytokine, integrin, and
hormone signaling pathways which regulates processes such as cell
proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis and
plays a pivotal role in growth factor and cytokine signaling.
Gain-of-function SHP2 mutations are associated with various kinds of
leukemia, and solid tumors. This makes SHP2 an attractive target for
anticancer therapy. We are developing SHP2 inhibitors as novel anticancer
drugs. Previously, we have reported on SPI-112 and its methyl ester
prodrug SPI-112Me. However, the poor solubility of SPI-112Me has become
an obstacle for in vivo studies. In ongoing study, we generate SPI-112
analogs to further improve physicochemical properties of these SHP2
inhibitors, such as solubility and cell permeability. To this aim, we
synthesized SPI-112 derivatives containing various phosphotyrosine mimics
and their prodrugs. SPI-112 derivatives of SHP2 inhibitors having
improved properties have been obtained in this effort.
