Title: TOPK phosphorylation of MKP1 prevents solar ultraviolet
irradiation-induced inflammation by inhibiting p38 signaling


Solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is a major environmental factor that
causes DNA damage, inflammation, and skin cancer. T-LAK cell-originated
protein kinase (TOPK) is widely expressed in both normal and cancer cells
and functions to inhibit apoptosis and promote carcinogenesis. However,
its function in inflammation is not known. The p38 MAPK signaling pathway
plays an important role in solar UV light-induced inflammation. The
phosphorylation level of p38 was reported to be up-regulated after
transfection of the TOPK gene into COS-7 cells. We found that the
phosphorylation level of p38 was increased in TOPK-/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) compared with TOPK+/+ MEFs after stimulation with
solar UV light. Our observations unveil a novel role for TOPK. We found
that TOPK negatively regulated the activity of p38 by phosphorylating the
p38-specific phosphatase MKP1 and enhancing the stability of MPK1.
Notably, the absence of TOPK in mice resulted in a striking increase in
skin inflammation. Therefore, we conclude that TOPK has a protective
function in solar UV light-induced inflammation.
