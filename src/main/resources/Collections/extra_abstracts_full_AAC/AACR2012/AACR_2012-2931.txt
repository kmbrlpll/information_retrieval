Title: Inherited variation at chromosome 12p13.33 including RAD52
influences squamous cell lung carcinoma risk


While lung cancer is largely caused by tobacco smoking, inherited genetic
factors play a role in its etiology. Genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) in Europeans have robustly demonstrated only three polymorphic
variations influencing lung cancer risk. Tumor heterogeneity may have
hampered the detection of association signal when all lung cancer
subtypes were analyzed together. In a GWAS of 5,355 European smoking lung
cancer cases and 4,344 smoking controls, we conducted a pathway-based
analysis in lung cancer histologic subtypes with 19,082 SNPs mapping to
917 genes in the HuGE-defined inflammation pathway. We identified a
susceptibility locus for squamous cell lung carcinoma (SQ) at 12p13.33
(RAD52, rs6489769), and validated it in three independent samples
totaling 3,359 SQ cases and 9,100 controls (odds ratio=1.20,
Pcombined=2.3108). The combination of pathway-based approaches and
information on disease specific subtypes can improve the identification
of cancer susceptibility loci in heterogeneous diseases.
