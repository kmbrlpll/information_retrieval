Title: Real-time imaging of v integrin-GFP expression in osteosarcoma
cells trafficking in blood vessels of nude mice


We report here real-time imaging of v integrin-GFP expression during
osteosarcoma cell trafficking in blood vessels in nude mice. 143B
osteosarcoma cells were transfected with an v integrin-GFP vector.
Confocal microscopy demonstrated that v integrin immunofluorescent
staining colocalized with v integrin-GFP. Osteosarcoma 143B cells
expressing v integrin-GFP (1106) were injected in the epigastric
cranialis vein. Subsequently, round osteosarcoma cells diffusely
expressing v integrin-GFP were observed in larger veins. In contrast,
punctuated v integrin-GFP was imaged in stretched cells attached to
narrow vessel walls. Osteosarcoma cells, arrested in venous valves, were
observed to strongly express v integrin-GFP. v integrin-GFP allows the
imaging of v integrin expression during cancer cell trafficking and
arrest in blood vessels which will enable the further understanding of
its role in this process.
