Title: BubR1 is modified by sumoylation during mitotic progression


BubR1 functions as a crucial component that monitors proper chromosome
congression and mitotic timing during cell division. We investigated
molecular regulation of BubR1 and found that BubR1 was modified by an
unknown post-translation mechanism during the cell cycle, resulting in a
significant mobility shift on denaturing gels. We termed it BubR1-M as
the nature of modification was not characterized. Extended (>24 h)
treatment of HeLa cells with a microtubule disrupting agent including
nocodazole and taxol or release of mitotic shake-off cells into fresh
medium induced BubR1-M. BubR1-M was derived from neither phosphorylation
nor acetylation. Ectopic expression coupled with pulling down analyses
showed that BubR1-M was derived from SUMO modification. Mutation analysis
revealed that lysine 250 was a crucial site for sumoylation.
Significantly, compared with the wild-type control, ectopic expression of
a sumoylation-resistant mutant of BubR1 induced chromosomal
missegregation and mitotic delay. Combined, our study identifies a new
type of post-translational modification that is essential for BubR1
function during mitosis.
