Title: Functional genomic shRNA screens reveal that the canonical Wnt
pathway protects lung cancer cells from EGFR inhibition


Lung cancers are the leading cause of cancer deaths globally. In
particular, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a devastating disease,
and is rarely curable. Hyperactivation of mitogenic signaling cascades is
a hallmark of cancer development, including for lung cancers. Targeted
therapies inhibiting specific receptor tyrosine kinases have shown
clinical promise, but rarely produce complete responses and are not
curative, suggesting the existence of escape mechanisms promoting cell
survival. Using a loss-of-function, whole genome shRNA screen, we
identified various components and mediators of the canonical Wnt pathway
that contribute to the maintenance of NSCLC cells during inhibition of
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Modulation of tankyrases,
casein kinases and different components of the Wnt pathway with shRNAs or
small molecules, in vitro and in vivo, significantly increased the
efficacy of EGFR inhibitors, thus revealing a critical role for the
canonical Wnt pathway in maintaining lung cancer cells during EGFR
inhibition. Targeting the Wnt/-catenin pathway together with EGFR
inhibition in the clinic could lead to more durable remissions for
non-small cell lung cancers.
