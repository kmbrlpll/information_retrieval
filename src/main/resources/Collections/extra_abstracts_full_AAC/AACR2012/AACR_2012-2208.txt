Title: JNK2 regulates the hif-1 mRNA stability in a nucleolin-dependent
manner


HIF-1 mRNA is regarded as constitutively and ubiquitously expressed no
matter the level of oxygen tension. But most recently, more and more labs
found that HIF-1 mRNA could be regulated by natural antisense
transcripts, potential microRNAs, and low O2 pressure in the renal
medulla in rats and in sea bass. In our current studies, we found that
nucleolin, the classic histone chaperon, was able to physically bind to
hif-1 mRNA and maintained its stability. Knocking down nucleolin by shRNA
obviously reduced HIF-1 protein induction in response to nickel treatment
resulting from the impaired expression of hif-1 mRNA. Both the promoter
luciferase assay and mRNA degradation rate assay by ActD clearly showed
that nucleolin knocking down did not change hif-1 transcription, but
rather affected its mRNA stability. Further work found JNK2 could
regulate nucleolin expression and subsequently affect its function in
stabilizing hif-1 mRNA, by which we provided more evidence for the
oncogenic role of JNK2 and nucleolin in regulating the cancer
environments by controlling HIF-1 expression.
