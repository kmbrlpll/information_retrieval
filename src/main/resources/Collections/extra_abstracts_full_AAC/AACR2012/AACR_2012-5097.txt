Title: Genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number aberrations in gastric
cancer


Genomic copy number aberrations (CNAs) are believed to play a major role
in the development and progression of human cancers. Although many CNAs
have been reported in gastric cancer, their relevance to gastric
carcinogenesis are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated CNAs
of 30 advanced gastric cancers (AGC) and 20 gastric carcinoma in situ
(CIS) by using array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). By
comparing the frequencies of CNAs in CISs with those in AGCs, we
identified several CNAs that were more frequent in AGCs than CISs. Among
them, gain of 20q13 was detected in almost all cases of AGC (29/30). We
further analyzed the expression of genes located on 20q13 and found that
8 genes were upregulated more than 2-fold on average compared with normal
tissues, suggesting that these genes may play an important role in the
progression of gastric cancer. Taken together, our data may provide
useful information about the involvment of genomic CNAs in gastric
carcinogenesis. References: 1. Tsukamoto et al, J Pathol.
