Title: Epigenomic profiling of oral cancer


Epigenetic aberration, such as dysregulation of DNA mathylation is often
associated with human carcinogenesis. To analyze DNA methylation profiles
of oral cancers, and to identify the methylation pattern specific to the
clinicopathological features, we performed genome-wide methylation
analysis using Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray system. We found
2,361 aberrantly methylated CpG sites in 59 oral cancers compared to 3
normal mucosal tissues. By unsupervised clustering analysis, oral cancer
was divided into two methylation epigenotypes that are significantly
correlated with incidence of lymph node metastasis and differentiation
grades. We selected the classifier genes that can predict tumor
metastasis in the training set, and demonstrated that they are validated
to be predictive in the independent test sample, preoperative biopsy
samples. In summary, we identified two methylation epigenotypes
correlated with clinical outcome in oral cancer, and candidate classifier
genes that would be useful in patient stratification for intensive
therapy to overcome the tumor recurrence.
