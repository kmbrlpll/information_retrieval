Title: Tumor hypoxia promotes tolerance and angiogenesis via CCL28 and
Treg cells


Although immune mechanisms can suppress tumor growth, tumors establish
potent and overlapping mechanisms that mediate immune evasion. Emerging
evidence suggests a link between tumor immune tolerance and angiogenesis.
Hypoxia, a condition known to drive tumor angiogenesis, results in
release of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules, which can
trigger tumor immune rejection. Thus, counter-activation of tolerance
mechanisms at the site of tumor hypoxia would be a critical condition to
maintain immunologic escape of tumors. However, a direct link between
tumor hypoxia and tolerance through the recruitment of regulatory cells
has not been established. We hypothesized that tumor hypoxia induces
expression of chemotactic factors promoting tolerance. Here we show that
tumor hypoxia promotes T regulatory (Treg) cell recruitment via the CCL28
chemokine, which in turn promotes tumor tolerance and angiogenesis. Thus,
peripheral immune tolerance and angiogenesis are intimately connected and
cooperate to sustain tumor growth.
