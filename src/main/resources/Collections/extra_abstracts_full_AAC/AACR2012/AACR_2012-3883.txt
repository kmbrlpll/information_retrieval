Title: Miniaturizing the GloSensor cAMP assay for MC4R screening using
the Echo acoustic liquid handler


As biological assays used for HTS and uHTS are miniaturized, it is
critical to maintain assay sensitivity while minimizing reagent volumes
and maximizing throughput. The GloSensor cAMP Assay provides an extremely
sensitive and easy to use, real-time luminescent assay format for the
interrogation of over expressed or endogenous GPCRs that signal via
changes in the intracellular concentration of cAMP. Tipless, touchless
transfers with the Echo liquid handler eliminate the need for costly
disposable tips and greatly simplify assay development efforts. Precise
and accurate drop placement eliminates cross-contamination. In this work,
we demonstrate optimization of the GloSensor cAMP Assay in low-volume
format using a stably transfected HEK293 cell line model expressing the
melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and a cAMP-sensing variant of firefly
luciferase. We show that the Echo liquid handler is able to titrate small
molecule and peptide agonists and antagonists, as well as transfer the
GloSensor cAMP Reagent, providing robust assay results that are achieved
with significantly reduced volumes of cells and compound.
