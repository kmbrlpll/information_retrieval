Title: Meta-analysis of posttranslational modifications in cancer


PhosphoSitePlus (http://www.phosposite.org) is a comprehensive and
easy-to-use resource that includes aggregated information about
experimentally observed post-translational modifications (PTMs) observed
in over thirty distinct types of cancer. Most of the cancer data is
derived from over 900 mass spectrometric datasets of human disease
tissues or cell lines, either reported in the literature or from studies
performed at Cell Signaling Technology. The four most highly represented
diseases are non-small cell lung carcinoma (269 datasets and over 5500
unique sites), breast cancers (99 datasets with over 2630 sites), acute
myelogenous leukemia (70 datasets with over 1860 sites), and chronic
myelogenous leukemia (115 datasets with over 1700 sites). Users can
extract datasets associated with specific diseases, and analyze the data
a number of newly-developed analytical tools. These include
motif-analysis, permitting users to determine if specific kinases appear
to be active in different diseases, and pathway analysis using novel
Cytoscape plugins. Datasets and Cytoscape pathways corresponding to
specific diseases and other data subsets can be downloaded from the site,
enabling users to apply their own bioinformatics analyses to the
information available at PhosphoSitePlus.
