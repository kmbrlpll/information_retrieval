Title: Regulation of pancreatic, gliosarcoma and non-small cell lung
cancer via CPI-613, a novel anticancer therapeutic agent


While the novel anticancer agent CPI-613, currently in clinical trials,
is primarily known to affect multiple cancer cell energy metabolic
processes and pathways, here we demonstrate that CPI-613 also shows
cancer-cell-cycle-specific effects on BxPC3 (human pancreatic) cancer
cells, SF539 (human gliosarcoma) cells, and H460 (human non-small cell
lung cancer) cells but not on non-transformed NIH3T3 (murine fibroblast)
cells. Specifically, gene microarray data demonstrates that CPI-613
affects signal transduction pathways and genes related to cell cycle
maintenance and progression as well as energetic metabolic processes and
pathways. The total RNA production was also significantly reduced in
cancer cells treated with CPI-613 compared to non treated controls.
Multiple cyclins, p27, p19, and CDK2 are specifically noted to be
downregulated in cancer cells treated with this drug, thereby halting the
cell cycle at multiple points. Further study of this phenomenon may lead
to additional indications for CPI-613 treatment.
