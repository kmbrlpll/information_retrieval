Title: Proteolysis of pseudokinase PTK7 controls cancer cell invasion


Deregulated cell motility promotes cancer progression and metastasis, a
major cause of cancer patient death. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms regulating cell motility in malignancy will facilitate an
identification of novel anti-metastatic therapies. Recently, we
identified a new mechanism, the proteolytic control of directional cell
motility and invasion. The membrane protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7)
controls the orientation of cells in a tissue plane (planar cell
polarity, PCP) and inhibits cancer cell invasion. The pro-invasive
membrane type-1 matrix metalloprotease (MT1-MMP/MMP-14) directly cleaves
PTK7 at the cell surface and reverses the inhibitory anti-invasive signal
of the full-length PTK7. Thus, PTK7 proteolysis by MT1-MMP turns on cell
motility and invasion. This ubiquitous mechanism is conserved in
processes as diverse as embryo development and cancer cell invasion.
Because both the pro-invasive MT1-MMP and the polarity regulating PTK7
are linked to cancer, the precise understanding of the role of PTK7
proteolysis in cancer progression is important to discover novel
therapies.
