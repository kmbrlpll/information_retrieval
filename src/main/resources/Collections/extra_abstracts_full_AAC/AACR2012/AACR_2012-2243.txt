Title: Targeting the MUC1-C oncoprotein synergistically enhances
cytotoxicity of breast carcinoma cells in combination with PI3K inhibitors


The mucin 1 (MUC1) heterodimeric protein is aberrantly overexpressed by
most human breast carcinomas and contributes to the malignant phenotype.
However, there are no effective agents that directly inhibit the
oncogenic MUC1-C subunit and induce death of breast cancer cells. We have
synthesized MUC1-C peptide inhibitors that bind to the MUC1-C cytoplasmic
domain and block the formation of MUC1-C dimers in breast cancer cells.
We have shown that inhibition of MUC1-C arrests growth and induces
necrotic death of the breast carcinoma cells. Here we demonstrate that
combining the MUC1-C inhibitor GO-203-2C with agents that target PI3K
(LY294002, GDC0941) induces highly synergistic cytotoxicity of breast
carcinoma cells. Notably, GO-203-2C significantly enhanced the
effectiveness of these PI3K inhibitors by contributing to the
downregulation of p-AKT and p-S6K. Taken together, these findings provide
support for combining PI3K inhibitors and GO-203-2C, an agent now
undergoing Phase I evaluation, to improve treatment of patients with
breast cancer.
