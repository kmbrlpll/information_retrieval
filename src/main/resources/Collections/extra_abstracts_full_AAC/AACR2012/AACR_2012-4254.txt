Title: Human neuroendocrine Bon 1 cells as a three-dimensional model for
the study of human neuroendocrine tumor therapy


Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are rare tumors, with an incidence of
one to two per 100000 individuals per year, and they account for 1-2% of
all pancreatic neoplasms. Currently, much needed is to develop the
therapeutical drugs for patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
Human pancreatic neuroendocrine BON 1 cell line is widely used for
testing the therapeutic drugs in vitro. Here, we develop an alternative
research model that better mimics the in vivo tumor tissue organization
and microenvironments. This method produces in vitro three-dimensional
(3D) tumor spheroids from human pancreatic BON1 cells. The 3D tumor
spheroids generated in vitro exhibit the characteristics of avascular
tumors. Structurally and genetically the 3D spheroids show similarity to
the xenograft BON1 tumor and are more tumorigenic than 2D monolayer BON1
cells. We also present how to use these 3D spheroids to screen the
therapeutic drugs. This method will help us establish human
neuroendocrine tumor spheroids for cancer therapy.
