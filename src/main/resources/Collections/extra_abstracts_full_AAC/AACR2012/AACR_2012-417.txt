Title: Inflammation initiates OCT4/NANOG expression through IL-6-IGF-1R
signaling activation and is associated with early recurrence of
HBV-related HCC


Inflammatory microenvironment is a well-known promoter of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), a cancer with high rates of postoperative recurrence and
poor prognosis. However, mechanisms underlying the inflammation-induced
HCC promotion remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate the effect of
proinflammatory cytokine IL6 on IGF-1R signaling activation which
initiates OCT4/NANOG expression and is associated with HBV-related HCC
(HBV-HCC) recurrence. In this study, real-time quantitative PCR analysis
demonstrated a high correlation between IGF-1R and OCT4/NANOG
transcriptional expression in human HCC frozen tissues (N=119, R=0.8097
for OCT4; R= 0.8375 for NANOG). Interestingly, the OCT4, NANOG, or IGF-1R
level in HBV-HCC was significantly higher than that in non HBV-HCC.
Cultivation of cells in inflammation condition medium (Inflam-CM)
increased OCT4/NANOG level in HBV+HBsAg+ cells (HepG2.2.15 and Hep3B),
but not in HBV+HBsAg (HA22T) or HBVHBsAg cells (HepG2 and Huh7).
Epifluorescence/luciferase assay further demonstrated that Inflam-CM
increased the GFP+ cell population as well as the luciferase activity of
OCT4 promoter-GFP/luciferase-HepG2.2.15 cells. Besides, Inflam-CM
significantly increased the IGF-1/IGF-1R transcriptional level and
activated the IGF-1R signaling (phospho-IGF-1R and phospho-Akt) in
HepG2.2.15 and Hep3B. Blockage of IGF-1R phosphorylation by
picropodophyllin (PPP) dramatically decreased the OCT4/NANOG
transcriptional activity. IL-6 stimulated the autocrinal IGF-I and IL-6
expression whereas AG490 (a phospho-STAT inhibitor) decreased the IGF-1R
phosphorylation. The significant clinical association between early and
overall postoperative recurrence and IGF-1R/OCT4/NANOG expression in both
gene (real time RT-PCR) and protein (immunohistochemical staining) levels
were demonstrated. When etiologic differences were considered,
HBV-positive patients have the trend towards early HCC recurrence.
Conclusion: Niche inflammatory stress might activate an autocrinal
IL-6-IGF-I/IGF-1R-Akt signaling and OCT4/NANOG expression which is
associated with early HBV-HCC recurrence. These results provide potential
targets for individualized adjuvant therapy for HBV-HCC.
