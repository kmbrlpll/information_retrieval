Title: Targeting FoxM1 in p53-null tumors


Forkhead box transcription factor FoxM1 is overexpressed in many types of
human cancers and promotes tumor development in multiple ways. It is also
considered as a potential target for cancer therapy. Because greater than
half of the human cancers harbor p53 mutations, we investigate the effect
of FoxM1-targeting in spontaneous p53-null tumors. We show that reducing
FoxM1 inhibits growth of the p53 null thymic lymphoma and sarcoma cells.
In addition, ablation of FoxM1 retards the growth of the p53-null tumors
in mouse xenograft model. Moreover, induction of apoptotic cell death is
observed in p53 null cells after deletion of FoxM1, accompanied by
decreased expression of the FoxM1 target gene Survivin. The ARF26-44
peptide, which inhibits the activity of FoxM1 by targeting it to the
nucleolus, is able to effectively induce apoptosis in the p53 null
spontaneous tumors. Together, our observations suggest that FoxM1
functions are critical for p53-null tumors and FoxM1 is a therapeutic
target of human tumors carrying loss of function p53 mutations.
