Title: Modulation of epidermal growth factor induction of migration by
integrin-linked kinase


Epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling is central for proliferation,
survival and motility in epithelial cells. Cell migration is an
obligatory prerequisite for metastasis and requires the development of
front-rear polarity. EGF stimulation in various epithelial cell types
induces formation of protrusions and migration via RhoG and Rac1
activation. We now demonstrate that treatment of primary epidermal
keratinocytes with EGF, but not with other growth factors that promote
cell migration, induces cell polarization mediated by complexes
containing RhoG, integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and Engulfment and Cell
Motility-2 (ELMO2). This process requires the tyrosine kinase activity of
the EGF receptor. Further, ELMO2, ILK, Rac1 and integrin beta1 are
obligatory effectors in this pathway, as inactivation or knockdown of the
genes or mRNA encoding these proteins abrogates the stimulatory effect of
EGF. Thus, we have identified a novel pathway that links EGF receptor
stimulation with RhoG/ELMO2/ILK complexes and activation of Rac1 in the
acquisition of front-rear polarity.
