Title: Imaging stromal recruitment during liver metastasis formation in
the GFP-MUP-uPA mouse


Major urinary protein-urokinase type plasminogen activator (MUP-uPA)
transgenic mice develop liver disease resembling that described for
albumin promoter-uPA transgenic mice. We have developed the GFP-MUP-uPA
mice, by crossing MUP-uPA mouse with transgenic C57/BL6 mouse expressing
GFP. Hepatocyte fluorescence in this model is relatively weak. In
contrast, GFP fluorescence of non-parenchymal cells such as stellate
cells, Kupper cells and endotherial cells is very bright green more than
parenchymal cells enabling the portal vein and sinusoid structure to be
clearly visualized Huh7 liver cancer cells expressing red fluorescent
protein (RFP) were injected in the spleen of MUP-uPA transgenic mice. By
day 7, the Huh7-RFP celsl were visualized in the liver with the Olympus
FV1000 conforcal microscope. The hepatoma cells grew around the sinusoids
of the host liver. The liver-metastatic Huh7-RFP cells recruited bright
GFP-expressing non-parenchymal cells. This model enables imaging the
effects of uPA on liver metastasis and stromal recruitment enabling the
metastasis to progress.
