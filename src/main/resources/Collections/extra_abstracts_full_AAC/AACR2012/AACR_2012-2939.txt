Title: Discovery and synthesis of highly potent and selective small
molecule inhibitors of the histone methyltransferase EZH2


The histone methyltransferases are a group of enzymes which catalyze the
transfer of a methyl group from the co-factor S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM)
to the lysine and arginine residues of histone tails. This
post-translational modification is a key event in maintaining gene
expression patterns. In recent years, the relationships between aberrant
histone methylation patterns and cancer progression have been recognized.
These developments, along with an improved understanding of the
underlying structural biology, have made histone methyltransferases
highly attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. The histone
lysine methyltransferase EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2) is frequently
over-expressed in a wide variety of cancerous tissues. There is a strong
correlation between overexpression of EZH2 and aberrant transcriptional
signaling in cells, ultimately resulting in poor clinical prognosis.
Inhibition of EZH2 is expected to alter transcriptional expression and
ultimately lead to an improved clinical outcome. This presentation will
describe medicinal chemistry efforts in the development of highly potent
and selective small molecule inhibitors of EZH2. The synthesis, SAR, and
identification of a clinical candidate will be discussed.
