Title: A combined processing and assessment workflow for SNV and indel
calling on exome sequencing of tumor samples


A workflow for exome sequencing is established using multiple callers for
SNV and indel. A spectrum of measures is looked at to understand the
diversity and characteristics of the samples. Two common workflows for
variant calling are used, namely GATK unified genotyper and Samtools
mpileup. Illumina paired end 90 base reads are mapped to the human genome
using BWA. Variants called by GATK and Samtools are compared and merged
to give a unified set of calling in VCF format. This approach gives
additional confidence in calls supported by both callers as there are
technical differences in the two workflows. dbSNP rate and TI/TV ratio
are used to assess the general quality (sensitivity and specificity) of
the calls. It is observed that tumor samples with very low and high TI/TV
novel ratio are largely lung and melanoma samples respectively. They are
likely to be UV and smoking induced DNA mutation. This affects the
overall TI/TV ratio. A handful of samples also exhibit high variant count
that is uniquely found (private) in the sample alone. This correlates
with lower than expected dbSNP rate.
