Title: Mouse models of clinical oligo- and poly-metastatic progression


We previously proposed a metastatic state defined by a limited number of
metastases, termed oligometastasis(es). These limited metastases may be
cured by metastasis-directed treatments in contrast to widespread
metastatic disease. While many animal models of polymetastases exist, an
oligometastasis(es) model is lacking. Here, we report the first mouse
xenograft model of oligometastasis(es) employing the MDA-MB-435 human
tumor that maintains a stable oligometastatic phenotype in vivo. We also
developed an MDA-MB-435 polymetastatic progression model in which the
pattern of dissemination induced poly-foci in the lung, or to multiple
anatomic sites including lung, heart, muscle, pleura, bone and peritoneal
cavity. We performed microRNA expression profiling from distinct lung
metastases of oligometastatic and polymetastatic animals. MicroRNA
expression distinguished oligometastatic cell lines from those of
polymetastatic, and accurately identified oligometastatic patients from a
prior clinical study who failed to develop widespread metastases
(p=0.005). These findings form the basis for investigating mechanisms
underlying the specific metastatic pattern of individual cancers.
