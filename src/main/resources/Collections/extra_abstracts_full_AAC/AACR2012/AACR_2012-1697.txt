Title: Gadd45A expression is high in luminal A and her2 human breast
cancers, but frequently absent in triple negative breast cancers


Gadd45a is a stress sensor, playing an important role in tumorigenesis.
Generation and side by side analysis of breast cancer prone MMTV-myc and
MMTV-ras mice highlight a unique role for Gadd45a as either a suppressor
or promoter of breast cancer development, employing distinct signaling
pathways in response to distinct oncogenic stress stimuli. Thus, it
appears that gadd45a can function to either promote or suppress breast
tumor development in mice via engagement of different signaling pathways
depending on the molecular nature of the activated oncogene. Extending
the work to human breast cancer has provided initial, novel data, showing
that Gadd45a, which is not expressed in normal breast tissue, is
expressed at high levels in less aggressive breast cancers and is low or
absent in more aggressive subtypes. Notably, Gadd45a is expressed at very
high levels in luminal A and her2 positive breast cancers, but frequently
is absent in triple negative breast cancers. Experiments are currently
underway to elucidate the functional role of Gadd45a in human breast
cancer.
