Title: In silico identification and biological evaluation of potent small
molecule inhibitors targeting GAB1 pleckstrin homology domain


The Grb2-associated binder-1 (GAB1) over-expressed in many cancers
represents a novel therapeutic target that integrates signals from
different systems such as MET and PI3K/Akt pathways. It mediates
processes involved in tumor progression and metastasis. In this study we
have identified novel inhibitors targeting the pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain of GAB1 for cancer treatment. To this end, a homology model of
GAB1 PH domain was constructed, followed by structural refinement using
molecular dynamics. The resulting structure was applied to
high-throughput virtual screening of 5 million compounds and 19 hits were
selected for experimental evaluation. We found that 6 compounds bound to
the PH domain of GAB1 as measured by surface plasmon resonance
spectroscopy, with a KD. Out of these 6 hits, all of them inhibited the
HGF-I induced phosphorylation of GAB1 Tyr627 in T47D and inhibited T47D
and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines proliferation. Three of them
exhibited selective binding to GAB1 PH domain as compared to the PH
domain of IRS-1 and AKT. This demonstrates for the first time the
identification of novel GAB1 PH domain inhibitors which may be used for
targeted breast cancer therapy.
