Title: Microfluidic analysis of triple negative breast cancer epithelial
cells in response to chemotherapeutic treatments coupled with oxygen
gradients


Multi-trap nanophysiometers (MTNPs) are used in trapping and studying
very small numbers of cells. These precisely manufactured instruments,
made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), contain microfluidic channels and
chambers that house arrays of three-sided cell traps. Trapped MCF7 breast
cancer cells were perfused with media and gradients of chemotherapeutic
agents specific to triple-negative breast cancer while oxygen levels were
modulated within the device and quantified by the incorporation of an
oxygen-sensing film. Rapid switching between perfusion channels and gas
enabled precise dosing of cells with chemotherapeutic agents in a chamber
simulating a variety of tumor microenvironments ranging from anoxic to
normoxic. Preliminary results show a positive correlation between oxygen
concentration and non-translational motion of trapped cells over a four
hour time period.
