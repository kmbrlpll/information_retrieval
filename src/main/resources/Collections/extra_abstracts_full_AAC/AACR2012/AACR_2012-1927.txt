Title: Mechanistic characterization of SC144 in colon cancer


Recently, we have designed and synthesized a novel quinoxalinhydrazide,
SC144, that showed cytotoxicity in a panel of human cancer cell lines.
Here, we found that SC144 exhibited anticancer activity in a panel of
drug-sensitive and drug-resistant colon cancer cell lines. To study the
molecular anticancer mechanism of SC144, we further found that it
arrested cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis in colon cancer
cells, which is associated with the decrease in cyclin D1 expression and
the activation of the p38/IL-24/Fas pathway. Additionally, in surgical
specimens from 202 colorectal patients, Cyclin D1 expression was
significantly higher and IL-24 expression was significantly lower in
cancer tissue than in adjacent normal mucosa, and there was a significant
correlation between IL-24 level in colorectal cancer tissue and the
survival rate of patients after cytoreductive surgery (P = 0.007). This
clinical evidence further supports that SC144 is a promising therapeutic
agent for colon cancer therapy.
