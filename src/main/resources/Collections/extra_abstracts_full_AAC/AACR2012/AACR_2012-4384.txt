Title: Targeting of 4-1BB by monoclonal antibody, PF-05082566, enhances T
cell function and promotes antitumor activity


4-1BB (CD137, TNFRSF9) is a costimulatory receptor expressed in an
activation induced manner on several subsets of immune cells. Numerous
studies of mouse and human T cells indicate that 4-1BB promotes enhanced
cellular proliferation, survival, and cytokine production. 4-1BB agonist
mAbs have demonstrated efficacy in prophylactic and therapeutic settings
in both monotherapy and combination therapy tumor models and have
established durable anti-tumor protective T cell memory responses.
PF-05082566 is a fully human IgG2 which binds to the extracellular domain
of human 4-1BB with high affinity and specificity. In preclinical studies
this agonist antibody demonstrated its ability to activate NF-B and
induce downstream cytokine production, promote leukocyte proliferation,
and inhibit tumor growth in a human PBMC xenograft tumor model. The
mechanism of action and robust anti-tumor efficacy of PF-05082566 support
its clinical development for the treatment of a broad spectrum of human
malignancies.
