Title: High-throughput genotoxicity screening unlocks chemotherapeutic
potential of antioxidants


Human ATAD5 is a biomarker for identifying genotoxic compounds because
ATAD5 protein levels increase post-transcriptionally in response to DNA
damage. We screened over 4,000 compounds with a novel, cell-based
quantitative high-throughput ATAD5-luciferase assay detecting genotoxic
compounds. We identified 22 antioxidants, including resveratrol,
genistein, and baicalein, that are currently used or investigated for the
treatment of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteopenia,
osteoporosis, and chronic hepatitis, and for anti-aging. Treatment of
dividing cells with these compounds induced DNA damage and resulted in
cell death. Despite their genotoxic effects, resveratrol, genistein, and
baicalein did not cause mutagenesis, which is a major side effect of
conventional anti-cancer drugs. Furthermore, resveratrol and genistein
killed multi-drug resistant cancer cells. We therefore propose that
resveratrol, genistein, and baicalein are attractive candidates for
improved chemotherapeutic agents.
