Title: Ciclopirox olamine downregulates Cdc25A expression in tumor cells


Ciclopirox olamine (CPX), a synthetic fungicide clinically used to treat
mycoses of the skin and nails, has been demonstrated as a novel
anticancer agent. Recently we have identified that CPX inhibits tumor
growth by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells.
This study was set to investigate the underlying mechanisms. We found
that CPX slowed down cell cycle progression and accumulated cells at G1
phase in a concentration-dependent manner in human rhabdomyosarcoma
(Rh30) and breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231) cells. Concurrently, CPX
downregulated Cdc25A protein, a key cell cycle regulator that is
frequently overexpressed in tumor cells. Further studies revealed that
CPX did not alter the mRNA and protein synthesis level, but promoted the
protein degradation of Cdc25A. In addition, we found that CPX caused DNA
damage, activated ATR/ATM-Chk1 cascade, elevated phosphorylation of
Cdc25A (S76) and inhibitory phosphorylation on both CDK2 (T14/Y15) and
CDK6 (Y24), and reduced phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb).
Furthermore, CPX activated JNK pathway, which links to apoptosis, and is
negatively regulated by Cdc25A. Moreover, CPX disrupted the interaction
between ASK1 and Cdc25A. These results suggest that CPX may inhibit cell
proliferation and induce cell apoptosis by targeting Cdc25A.
