Title: Do-It-Yourself expression microdissection (DIY xMD): A low-cost,
high-throughput cell and organelle isolation system


Laser-based microdissection technologies precisely recover histological
regions or cells from cytology preparations and tissue sections. Yet, due
to the high-cost and time-intensiveness of these methods, coarse manual
microdissection is the most commonly used tool for laboratory-based
studies and clinical applications, enabling rapid procurement but at the
expense of reduced cell purity. We present a low-cost, do-it-yourself
expression microdissection (DIY xMD) kit that combines the speed and
ease-of-use of manual methods with the precision of laser-based
instruments. Using DIY xMD, we isolated cell targets including ER+ nuclei
and GMS-stained aspergillis fungi from clinical specimens. We also
demonstrate the advantage of cellular enrichment in a cytology-based
study where BRAF and KRAS mutations were masked by background cells in a
manual dissection, yet identifiable after cells were recovered by DIY
xMD. The new system makes high-throughput, efficient microdissection
accessible to investigators and clinicians throughout the world.
