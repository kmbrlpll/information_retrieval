Title: Generation and characterization of inducible KIF5B-RET mouse model
of non-small cell lung cancer


The new precision oncology requires identification of driver oncogenes,
validation of oncogene addiction, and development of oncogene-targeted
drugs. Lung cancer is molecularly heterogeneous characterized by various
genetic alterations, many of them occur at low frequencies. Recurrent RET
fusion genes have been found in 1-2% of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Among them KIF5B-RET fusion is the most prevalent and occurs
specifically in NSCLC. To develop an in vivo animal model for evaluation
of KIF5B-RET fusion in lung adenocarcinoma, we generated transgenic mice
containing a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible tetO-KIF5B-RET transgene. To
express KIF5B-RET in lung type II epithelial cells, tetO-KIF5B-RET mice
were crossed with CCSP-rtTA mice. CCSP-rtT/tetO-KIF5B-RET bitransgenic
mice were induced with Dox and lung tissues were analyzed. KIF5B-RET mRNA
and protein were detected in the lungs of Dox-induced
CCSP-rtTA/tetO-KIF5B-RET bitransgenic mice. Histological examinations
showed lung hyperproliferative lesions and tumors in Dox-induced
CCSP-rtTA/tetO-KIF5B-RET bitransgenic mice. Thus, KIF5B-RET fusion is a
driver oncogene sufficient to induce lung tumors in transgenic mice.
