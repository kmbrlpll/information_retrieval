Title: Single-molecule localization microscopy analysis of a cancer
metastasis-specific miRNA on the nanoscale


We propose a novel approach for the detection of small non-coding RNAs in
cells by Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM). We describe a
modified and upgraded SMLM-setup and apply this instrument in a first
proof-of-principle concept to human cancer cell lines. Our method is able
to visualize single microRNA molecules in fixed cells with a localization
accuracy of 10-15 nm, is able to quantify numbers and analyse clustering
and localization in particular subcellular sites, including exosomes. We
compared metastatic-site derived and primary site derived human
adenocarcinoma cultured colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, and (as a proof of
principle) evaluated the metastatically relevant miR-31 as a first
example. We observed that the subcellular distribution of miR-31
molecules in all cell lines was very heterogeneous with the largest
subpopulation of optically acquired low-metastatic cells characterized by
a low number of miR-31 molecules, as opposed to a significantly higher
number in the majority of the highly metastatic cells.
