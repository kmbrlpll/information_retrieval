Title: HB-EGFmediated CITED4 signaling in lung cancer


Abnormal activation of theEGFreceptor (EGFR)signaling is a hallmark
oflung cancer. However, the role of heparin-binding EGF-like growth
factor (HB-EGF), one of EGFR ligands, in lung tumorigenesishas been
unappreciated. In this study, we showed that HB-EGF was highly expressed
in a subgroup of lung cancer cells, the proliferation of which was
dependent on HB-EGF signaling. Members of CITED family proteins respond
to various cytokine signalings, regulating cell proliferation; among
them, we identified CITED4 as a downstream effecter of HB-EGF. We
revealed that CITED4 was upregulated by HB-EGF through a STAT3 dependent
pathway. Moreover, CITED4-silencing attenuated HB-EGF-mediated lung
cancer cell proliferation. ChIP analysis and promoter reporter assay
showed that STAT3 bound CITED4 promoter, enhancing CITED4 transcription.
Co-immunoprecipitation analysis identified MYC as a CITED4-interacting
protein. Furthermore, we found that CITED4 expression promoted
MYC-mediated transcription of cyclin D1 promoter, leading to increased
G1/S cell cycle transition. Thus, our findings support that HB-EGF-CITED4
signaling cascade plays a critical role in aberrant proliferation in lung
cancer with potential as a biomarker for lung cancer progression.
