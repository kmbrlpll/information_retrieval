Title: Genomic deregulation and therapeutic role of the cell-cycle kinase
TLK2 in more aggressive breast cancers


More aggressive breast cancers often coincide with enhanced chromosomal
instability (CIN), which poses a great challenge to clinical management.
By integrative analysis of genomic data, we observed the amplification of
tousled-like kinase 2 (TLK2), a cell cycle serine-threonine kinase, in
approximately 9% of breast cancer, which is more frequent in the luminal
B and late-stage breast tumors. The resulting TLK2 upregulation
correlates with the level of CIN in breast tumors, and predicts worse
outcome regardless of endocrine therapy. Further studies suggest that
TLK2 overexpression leads to a G2/M checkpoint defect, delayed DNA
repair, and enhanced invasiveness. TLK2 silencing selectively inhibits
the growth of TLK2-high breast cancer cells, and induces apoptosis. This
response is retained in the breast cancer cells with acquired endocrine
resistance. TLK2 inhibition in a preclinical tumor model significantly
improved progression-free survival. Together, targeting TLK2 presents an
attractive therapeutic strategy on TLK2-amplified breast cancers.
