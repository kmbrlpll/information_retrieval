Title: Substrates of protein kinase C drive cell rac1-dependent motility


This laboratory has identified and/or characterized substrates of PKC
that upon phosphorylation give rise to motility, an aspect of metastasis.
By use of the traceable kinase method, we discovered that alpha-tubulin
and Cdc42 effector protein-4 (CEP4) are PKC substrates. Phosphorylation
of alpha-tubulin stimulates its incorporation into microtubules (MTs),
consequently increasing the stability and prolonged growth of MTs and
leading to the activation of the small GTPase Rac1. CEP4 undergoes
phosphorylation by PKC that results in its release from Cdc42, whereupon
CEP4 binds a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that in turn
activates Rac1 GTPase. These results imply that Rac1 acts as a node in
pathways driven by phosphorylated PKC substrates. Since translocation of
IQGAP to the membrane is known to be promoted by Rac1, a role is explored
in non-transformed human MCF-10A cells that express a specific
phospho-mimetic mutant substrate. In addition, the phospho-mimetic mutant
for each substrate expressed in human metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells
produces different morphologies in 3-D growth assays. This research is
being supported by NIH CA125632.
