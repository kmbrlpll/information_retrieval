Title: Curative fluorescence-guided surgery of pancreatic cancer in
combination with UVC irradiation in orthotopic mouse models


Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) has shown great promise, but has not
been shown to be curative. Human MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells,
expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), were implanted orthotopically
in nude mice. Brightlight surgery (BLS) was performed on 24 tumor-bearing
mice. After BLS, mice were randomized to BLS-only (n = 8) or FGS (n = 8)
or FGS-UVC (n = 8) groups. The residual tumors were resected using a
portable imaging system. FGS or FGS followed by UVC irradiation with 2700
J/m2 UVC (254 nm) was performed. Residual tumor area after FGS was
significantly smaller than after BLS only (p = 0.007). The BLS treated
mice had reduced survival compared to FGS- and FGS-UVC-treated mice for
both relapse-free survival (RFS) (p,0.001 and p,0.001, respectively) and
overall survival (OS) (p,0.001 and p,0.001, respectively). With FGS-UVC,
RFS lasted at least 150 days indicating the animals were cured. UVC
irradiation in combination with FGS has curative potential in the clinic.
