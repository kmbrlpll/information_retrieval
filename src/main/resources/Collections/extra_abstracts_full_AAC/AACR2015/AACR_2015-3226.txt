Title: Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models for triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC): A pre-clinical platform for drug discovery


In the United States, TNBC comprises 15-20% of breast cancers and are
characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor,
progesterone receptor and receptor tyrosine protein kinase ERBB2 or
Her-2/neu oncogene amplification. As a result, this type of breast cancer
is difficult to treat as most of the chemotherapies target these 3
receptors. TNBC is highly aggressive and is associated with high
morbidity, mortality and shorter disease-free survival. Given its
heterogeneous clinical presentation, histology and response to therapy,
prognosis and management of TNBC is complicated. In this study, we report
development and characterization of the TNBC PDX model. We used patient
derived TNBC tissues to generate 5 new TNBC models in NOD-SCID mice.
Patient tumors were pre-screened for their ER, PR and Her-2/Neu
expression by IHC, prior to inoculation in mice. Efficacy of two standard
of care drugs, Cisplatin and Vinorelbine in the TNBC PDX model
demonstrates the potential utility of the TNBC model in drug discovery
effort in oncology for treatment of TNBC.
