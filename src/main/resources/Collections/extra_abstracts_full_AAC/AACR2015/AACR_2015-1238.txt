Title: Effects of MLH1 on prostate cancer cell function


Mismatch repair (MMR) enzymes have been shown to be deficient in prostate
cancer. MMR can influence the regulation of tumor development in various
cancers but their role on prostate cancer has not been investigated. The
aim of the present study was to determine the functional effects of the
mutL-homolog 1 (MLH1) gene on growth of prostate cancer cells. The DU145
prostate cancer cell line has been previously established as
MLH1-deficient and thus, this cell line was utilized to determine effects
of MLH1 by gene expression. Lack of MLH1 expression was confirmed by
Western blotting in DU145 cells whereas levels were high in normal
prostatic PWR-1E and RWPE-1 cells. Stably expressing MLH1 in DU145
resulted in decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion
properties. Lack of cell growth using athymic nude mice model also
indicated a tumor suppressive effect by MLH1. Interestingly, MLH1 caused
an increase in apoptosis along with phosphorylated c-Abl, and treatment
with MLH1 siRNAs countered this effect. Furthermore, inhibition of c-Abl
with imatinib (STI571) also abrogated the effect on apoptosis caused by
MLH1. These results demonstrate MLH1 protects against prostate cancer
development by inducing c-Abl-mediated apoptosis.
