Title: TCF4 is a molecular target of resveratrol-induced apoptosis in
colon cancer


TCF-4 (T cell factor-4) is a member of the TCF/LEF (lymphoid enhancer
factor) family of transcription factors. Although dysregulation of
-catenin is decisive for the initiation and progression of colorectal
cancer, the role of TCF4 in transcriptional regulation of their target
gene remained poorly understood. The current study was performed to see
if TCF4 could be molecular target for anti-cancer compounds. Several
phytochemicals including resveratrol repressed expression of TCF4 in
human colorectal cancer cells. Resveratrol decreases accumulation of
ectopically expressed TCF4 protein without changes of TCF4 transcription.
Pre-treatment of MG-132 and lactacystin ameliorates
resveratrol-stimulated downregulation of TCF4. Resveratrol-treated cells
showed longer half-life of TCF4. Resveratrol increased phosphorylation of
TCF4 at serine/threonine residues through ERK and p38-dependent pathways.
Knockdown of TCF4 decreased TCF/-catenin-mediated transcriptional
activity and sensitized resveratrol-induced apoptosis. The current study
provides new mechanistic link between TCF4 downregulation and significant
benefits of phytochemicals.
