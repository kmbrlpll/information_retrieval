Title: Development of a syngeneic metastatic mouse model of malignant
lymphoma


We have developed a mouse model of highly malignant lymphoma. The EL4
cell line was established from a lymphoma induced in a C57/BL6 mouse by
9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene. Red fluorescent protein (RFP)-EL4
lymphoma cells were established. EL4-RFP cancer cells were injected in
the tail vein of C57/BL6 GFP transgenic mice. EL4-RFP metastasis was
observed in the lymph nodes of the superior mediastinum and in the liver
28 days later. The EL4-RFP tumors were visualized in the liver with the
Olympus SZX7 microscope. Large EL4-RFP liver metastases in C57/BL6 GFP
mice had GFP stromal cells derived from the host animal around the edge
of EL4-RFP tumors. In addition, EL4-RFP lymphoma cells metastasis was
formed in perigastric lymph node. EL4-RFP lymphoma cells circulated in
the peripheral blood. Furthermore, EL4-RFP lymphoma cells were observed
in bone marrow of C57/BL6 GFP transgenic mice. In summary, lymph node
metastasis, liver metastasis and bone marrow metastasis were found
approximately 4 weeks after transplantation. This malignant lymphoma
model can be used to study early tumor development, metastasis, the role
of stroma and discovery and evaluation of novel therapeuticus for this
treatment-resistant disease.
