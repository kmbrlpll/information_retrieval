Title: Somatic alteration and depleted nuclear expression of BAP1 in
human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas


We have found a case of somatic non-synonymous mutation of BAP1,
substituting phenylalanine to isoleucine at codon 170 (F170I) out of 49
patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCs) examined by
Sanger's direct sequencing. By in vivo Ubiquitination assay,
deubiquitininase activity was suppressed in F170I, comparing with wild
BAP1. BAP1 localization assay revealed that F170I mutant preferred to
localize within cytoplasm although wild BAP1 mostly localizes within
nucleus. Microarray analysis revealed that F170I has drastically altered
gene expression profile. The following gene-ontology analyses indicated
that expression of genes involved in oncogenic pathways has drastically
altered by F170I. We have also found that BAP1 expression was depressed
around 10% of ESCs examined by immunohistochemistry. It is interesting
that nuclear BAP1-depleted cases have strong cytosolic expression of
BAP1, instead. As nuclear localization of BAP1 is important in tumor
suppressor function, BAP1 may be functionally inactivated around 10% of
ESCs.
