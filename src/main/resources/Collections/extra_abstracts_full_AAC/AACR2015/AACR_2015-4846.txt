Title: Automated RNA and DNA purification from FFPE samples


Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples are commonly used for
archiving pathology samples for use by many researchers including
clinical research labs. These samples provide a valuable tool for
retrospective studies of diseases such as cancer. Traditional methods for
the purification of DNA or RNA from FFPE tissue samples are often labor
intensive, include the use of hazardous organic reagents, and involve
difficult pre-processing steps. Here, we describe development of
automated methods for the purification of RNA or DNA from FFPE tissue
sections using the Maxwell RSC Instrument, which can process between 1
and 16 samples. DNA was purified from FFPE mouse brain, liver, lung, skin
and spleen as well as FFPE human colon. RNA was purified from FFPE mouse
brain, liver, lung, skin and spleen as well as FFPE human breast tissue.
Eluates were tested for inhibition in qPCR or RT-qPCR. A comparison with
another automated method was performed with FFPE mouse spleen and skin
and a human tissue. The Maxwell RSC methods produced high quality
amplifiable DNA or RNA from a variety of sample types with little or no
inhibition. In addition, these methods simplified pre-processing,
minimized hands-on time, and did not use hazardous organics.
