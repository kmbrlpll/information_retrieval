Title: Epigenetic inhibitors targeting colon cancer stem cells


Colon cancer is one of the top leading causes of death in the world. Even
after surgery and chemotherapy, there are still many patients who will
experience relapse. Cancer stem or initiating cells (CSCs) are a small
subset of self-renewing and highly tumorigenic cells, which are resistant
to existing chemotherapy. In addition, CSCs are often enriched following
chemotherapy, and are responsible for relapse and subsequent metastasis.
One mechanism that possibly leads to chemotherapeutic failure is
epigenetic changes which involve aberrant chromatin modifications in
cancer and CSCs. Here, we performed microarray to investigate the gene
expression profiles of CSCs and non-CSCs populations identified by
ALDEFLUOR assay. Several genes were found to be highly expressed in CSCs
in different colon cancer cell lines. Then we performed inhibitor
screening to identify small molecules which can inhibit CSCs. Several
compounds inhibiting histone methylations were found to be effective in
reducing the CSCs population and expression of CSCs related genes. These
results support the use of epigenetic inhibitors together with
chemotherapy in refractory colon cancer.
