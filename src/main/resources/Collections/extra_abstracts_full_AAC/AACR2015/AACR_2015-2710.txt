Title: Tumorigenic activity of a novel KIF5B-RET fusion gene


The KIF5B-RET gene is a novel fusion gene resulting from pericentric
inversion between the kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) and the rearranged
during transfection (RET) gene, which recently isolated as an oncogene in
non-small cell lung cancers. In the present study, we investigated the
mechanisms associated with tumorigenic activity of KIF5B-RET fusion gene.
We used a HEK-293T cell line stably expressing the KIF5B-RET fusion gene
in pLOC lenti-viral vector. We investigated the tumor formation in a
xenograft mouse models after subcutaneous injection and confirmed the
expression of KIF5B-RET by PCR and western blot analysis. We also
explored the mechanism of KIF5B-RET fusion gene in stable cell line. The
KIF5B-RET stable cells showed upregulation of the cell growth, migration
and colony formation. Furthermore, the KIF5B-RET stable cells induced the
activation of BRAF, AKT and ERK compared with the parental cells. These
results suggest that the KIF5B-RET fusion gene promotes the cell
proliferation and tumorigenic activity though BRAF, AKT and ERK
activation. These findings may also provide the possible that KIF5B-RET
fusion gene as a driver in some subgroups of lung cancers.
