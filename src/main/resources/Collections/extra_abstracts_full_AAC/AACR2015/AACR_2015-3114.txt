Title: MicroRNA-205 signaling regulates mammary stem cell fate and
tumorigenesis


Dysregulation of epigenetic controls is associated with tumorigenesis in
response to microenvironmental stimuli; however, the regulatory pathways
involved in epigenetic dysfunction are largely unclear. We have
determined that a critical epigenetic regulator, microRNA-205 (miR-205),
is repressed by the ligand jagged1, which is secreted from the tumor
stroma to promote a cancer-associated stem cell phenotype. Knockdown of
miR-205 in mammary epithelial cells promoted epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), disrupted epithelial cell polarity, and enhanced
symmetric division to expand the stem cell population. Furthermore,
miR-205-deficient mice spontaneously developed mammary lesions, while
activation of miR-205 markedly diminished breast cancer stemness. These
data provide evidence that links tumor microenvironment and
microRNA-dependent regulation to disruption of epithelial polarity and
aberrant mammary stem cell division, which in turn leads to an expansion
of stem cell population and tumorigenesis. This study elucidates an
important role for miR-205 in the regulation of mammary stem cell fate,
suggesting a potential therapeutic target for limiting breast cancer
genesis.
