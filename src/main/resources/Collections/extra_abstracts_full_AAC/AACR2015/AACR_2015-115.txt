Title: SMYD2-mediated methylation regulates PTEN activity


PTEN is a well characterized tumor suppressor protein. PTEN counteract
PI3K-AKT pathway, which is one of the key signaling pathway for human
tumorigenesis, through its lipid phosphatase activity. Whereas PTEN is
known to be modified with various kinds of post-translational
modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination,
methylation has not been reported to date. In this study, we elucidated
SMYD2 (SET and MYND domain containing 2), a protein methyltransferase
related to human tumorigenesis, methylated PTEN at lysine 313 in C2
domain. SMYD2 knockdown caused downregulation of PI3K-AKT pathway and led
to cell growth suppression, suggesting that SMYD2-mediated PTEN
methylation would negatively regulate PTEN activity. Given the critical
role of PTEN as a tumor suppressor, our finding would not only contribute
to further understanding of the mechanism of SMYD2 depending human
tumorigenesis, but also may lead to a novel anti-cancer therapeutic
strategy.
