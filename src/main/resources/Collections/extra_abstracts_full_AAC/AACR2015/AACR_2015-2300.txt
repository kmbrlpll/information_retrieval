Title: LIN28 cooperates with Wnt signaling to drive invasive intestinal
and colorectal adenocarcinoma in mouse and human


Despite extensive investigation into the molecular basis of tumor
development, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major contributor to
cancer-related mortality. LIN28A and LIN28B are highly related
RNA-binding proteins that influence development, tissue regeneration and
oncogenesis. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of LIN28 drives
invasive intestinal adenocarcinoma and cooperates with the Wnt pathway to
promote tumor initiation and progression in murine models. Importantly,
conditional withdrawal of LIN28 reduced tumor volume and increased tumor
differentiation, indicating that LIN28 contributes to tumor maintenance.
Furthermore, co-expression of a LIN28-resistant form of the let-7
microRNA reduced tumor burden. We detected aberrant expression of LIN28
in 38% of a large series of tumor samples from human CRC, and LIN28
expression levels were associated with invasive tumor growth pattern. Our
robust late-stage CRC murine model demonstrates strong roles for LIN28 in
promoting CRC initiation, growth and progression, and suggests the
therapeutic potential in targeting the LIN28/let-7 pathway.
