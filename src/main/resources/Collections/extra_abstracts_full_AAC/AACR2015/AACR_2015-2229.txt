Title: CD117 expression and activation in prostate cancer progression


We have demonstrated that CD117/c-kit expression on circulating tumor
cells and in primary tumors correlates with advanced disease in prostate
cancer patients. In addition, the ligand for CD117, stem cell factor
(SCF) is increased in high-grade prostate cancer patients. To examine the
effects of CD117 activation and expression on prostate cancer
progression, we sorted CD117 positive and negative RM1 murine prostate
cancer cells and LNCaP-C4-2 human prostate cancer cells. Sorted cells
were then examined for tumorigenicity, proliferation, cell signaling,
cell migration, angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. A
xenograft model demonstrated that CD117 positive LNCaP-C4-2 tumors
generate larger tumors characterized by increased vascularization and
proliferation. In vitro, SCF induced CD117 activation results in altered
cell signaling, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In
addition, in vivo imaging of tumor growth demonstrated changes in tumor
cell organization between CD117 positive and negative cell populations.
In summary, CD117 expression and activation enhances prostate cancer
progression.
