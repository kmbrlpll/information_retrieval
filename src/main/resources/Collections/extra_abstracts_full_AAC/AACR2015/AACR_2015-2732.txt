Title: The role of protein P in hepatocellular carcinoma


Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most prevalent cancer and the
third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Although treatment
options have improved in the past 30 years, 5-year survival rate remains
below 20%. To improve the therapeutics of HCC, great efforts are needed
in understanding the mechanisms underlying HCC. Protein P, plays an
important role in the development of cancer. To clarify the role of P in
the development of HCC, we investigated the expression level of P in HCC
tissue chips. The results showed that P level is much higher in carcinoma
than adjacent tissue, and the overall 5-year survival is much better in P
low expression patients than in P high expression patients. P expression
was also found to be increased in HCC cell lines, compared with the
normal liver cell line. Further, the proliferation of HCC cell lines was
suppressed significantly by siRNA-mediated P knockdown in both anchorage
dependent and independent growth assays. These data suggested that P is a
crucial factor in the development of HCC, which might therefore represent
a novel therapeutic target for HCC.
