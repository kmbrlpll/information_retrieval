Title: Eradication of breast cancer with bone metastasis by autologous
formalin- fixed tumor vaccine (AFTV) and radiation


INTRODUCTION) Bone-metastatic mammary carcinoma patients show the
downhill course to a tragic ending despite of intensive chemo-radiation
therapy, except an our case concomitantly treated with AFTV (AACR2013,
World J Surg Oncol 2013; 11:127). We here report, as the second
successful case, eradication of a large bone metastasis of advanced
breast cancer after treatment with AFTV and radiation. (CASE) A 47-years
old female with stage II breast cancer was operated in July, 2000. Left
axillar recurrence was found 13 years later by ultrasonography and FNBC.
PET scan revealed a huge bone metastasis in sternum. She was treated with
radiation and AFTV (J Neurosurgery 2014;4:1) in Oct. - Nov. 2013.
Follow-up PET (Sep. 2014) showed no hot spot, and we diagnosed the
patient, complete remission.(CONCLUSION) Complete remission of bone
metastasis of mammary carcinoma is very rare. The initial successful case
beared triple-negative breast cancer. Treatment with AFTV and radiation
without intensive chemotherapy like the present case will be acceptable
to any patient with bone-metastatic mammary carcinoma, though a large
scale clinical trial should be required to confirm the therapeutic
efficacy of AFTV.
