Title: A technology platform for personalized medicine in melanoma


We developed patient derived xenografts (PDX), performed whole exome
sequencing (WES) and analyzed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to complement
clinical management of four melanoma patients. Synchronous treatment of
patients and mice showed that PDX responses mirrored those of the
patients tumor to BRAF inhibitors. PDXs were used to test second-line
treatments in relapsed patients and to validate WES-based therapies in
tumors that did not have a BRAF mutation. Longitudinal analysis of ctDNA
was predictive of responses to targeted and immunotherapies, and to
determine mechanisms of resistance. Thus, we describe a powerful
combination of techniques for personalized medicine in melanoma and
discuss the challenges and limitations of implementing these novel
technologies in patient management.
