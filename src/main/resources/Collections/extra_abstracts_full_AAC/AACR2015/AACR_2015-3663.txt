Title: Discovery of sulfonamide-piperidinones as potent inhibitors of the
MDM2-p53 protein-protein interaction


The p53 tumor suppressor is controlled by MDM2, which binds p53 and
negatively regulates its transcriptional activity and stability. Many
tumors overproduce MDM2 to impair p53 function. Therefore, restoration of
p53 activity by inhibiting p53-MDM2 binding represents an attractive,
novel approach to cancer therapy. We previously reported the discovery of
AM-8553, a potent and selective piperidinone inhibitor of the MDM2-p53
interaction (Rew et al. J. Med. Chem. 2012, 55, 4936). We report here
continued optimization of the N-alkyl substituent of this series, focused
in particular on a previously underutilized interaction in a shallow
cleft on the MDM2 surface that led to the discovery of a variety of
extremely potent sulfonamides such as 14 with an IC50 of 5.3 nM in the
cell proliferation assay. The compound 14 interacts specifically with the
p53-binding pocket of MDM2 and releases the p53 protein from negative
control. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with
sulfonamide 14 stabilizes p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The compound 14 showed excellent
efficacy and caused tumor regression in the SJSA-1 tumor xenograft model.
