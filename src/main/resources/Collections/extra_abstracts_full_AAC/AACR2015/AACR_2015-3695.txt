Title: Discovery of probes to evaluate the disruption of the
protein-protein interactions mediated by RPA70N


Replication Protein A (RPA) is a major regulator of checkpoint activation
and enhanced DNA repair in cancer cells. In response to genotoxic stress,
the RPA complex binds to and protects ssDNA while serving as a scaffold
to recruit critical checkpoint and DNA-damage response proteins through
the N-terminal region of the 70 kDa subunit of RPA (RPA70N). RNAi against
RPA has shown an expected toxicity against cancer cell lines. However,
specific disruption of the RPA protein-protein interactions mediated by
the RPA70N domain has the potential to produce selective killing of
cancer cells without of cytotoxicity due to interference with its
ssDNA-binding function. In order to accurately examine the therapeutic
relevance of the inhibition of RPA function, we have sought to discover
potent probe molecules that disrupt the interactions between RPA70N and
its binding partners.Here we describe the discovery of molecules to probe
RPA function using complementary fragment-based and traditional
high-throughput screening techniques. SAR studies and structure-based
design concepts used to optimize the lead series of interest will be
discussed along with the biochemical and cellular results obtained with
the compounds.
