Title: Protein kinase C loss-of-function mutations in cancer reveal role
as tumor suppressor


Protein kinase C (PKC) remains an elusive chemotherapeutic target despite
decades of research. To determine whether PKC isozymes function as
oncogenes or tumor suppressors, we analyzed 8% of PKC mutations
identified in human cancers. Surprisingly, the majority were
loss-of-function and none were activating. Loss-of-function mutations
were found in all PKC subgroups and acted by impeding 2nd messenger
binding or preventing processing phosphorylations. Bioinformatic analysis
revealed that PKC mutations might cooperate with co-occurring mutations
in cancer drivers. Correction of a patient-identified, loss-of-function
PKC mutation by CRISPR-mediated genome editing, in a colon cancer cell
line, suppressed anchorage-independent growth and reduced tumor growth in
xenograft models. Hemizygous deletion provided an anchorage-independent
growth advantage, revealing PKC is haploinsufficient for tumor
suppression. Several mutations were dominant-negative, suppressing global
PKC signaling output. These data establish that PKC isozymes generally
function as tumor suppressors, indicating that therapeutic strategies
should focus on restoring PKC activity, not inhibiting it.
