Title: KHF16, a new cycloartane triterpenoid isolated from Cimicifuga
foetida, suppresses triple-negative breast cancer by inhibiting the NF-B
signaling pathway


Triterpenoids extracted from Cimicifuga foetida were reported to inhibit
cancers by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In this study, KHF16
(24-acetylisodahurinol-3-O-b-D-xylopyranoside), a new cycloartane
triterpenoid isolated from the rhizomes of Cimicifuga foetida, showed
potent anti-cancer activity in multiple ERa/PR/HER2 triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. KHF16 significantly induces cell cycle
G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in both MDA-MB-468 and SW527 TNBC cell
lines. KHF16 reduces the expression levels of XIAP, Mcl-1, Survivin,
Bcl-2 and Cyclin B1/D1 proteins. Importantly, KHF16 inhibits TNF-induced
IKKa/b phosphorylation, IKBa phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation
and NF-B downstream target gene induction in TNBC cells. These results
suggest that KHF16 may inhibit TNBC through blocking the NF-B signaling
pathway.
