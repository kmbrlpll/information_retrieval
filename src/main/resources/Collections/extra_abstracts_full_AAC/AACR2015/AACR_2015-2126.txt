Title: Comprehensive transcriptome analysis reveals that
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is not globally suppressed in lung
adenocarcinomas


As a well-known mRNA surveillance mechanism, the nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay (NMD) pathway ensures the rapid degradation of mRNAs containing
premature termination codons (PTC). Prior research has shown that
features of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia and amino acid
deprivation, might inhibit NMD activity. However, a systemic analysis of
NMD in cancer is seldom performed. Rather than focusing on only a few NMD
targets and using artificial interventions as in previous experiments, we
aimed to analyze NMD in cancer from a global perspective. By analyzing
lung Adenocarcinomas in detail, we observed comparable decay efficiencies
in tumors for both annotated and predicted NMD targets. Interestingly,
the expression patterns of key NMD factors are altered, indicating that
cancer cells might prefer to use different NMD degradation pathways. We
also identified a subset of NMD targets with unique manners in either
tumor or adjacent tissues. Besides, our analyses further demonstrate that
the NMD efficiencies vary across tumors, supporting the heterozygosity of
lung Adenocarcinomas.
