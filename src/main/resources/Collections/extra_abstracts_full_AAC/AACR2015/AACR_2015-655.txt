Title: The next generation of targeted toxins: A novel deimmunized sarcin
ribotoxin fused with an EphA2 Abdurin binder


Abdurins are a novel antibody-like scaffold derived from the engineering
of a single CH2 domain (CH2D) of IgG. The prolonged serum half-life of
Abdurins, the result of retained FcRn binding, is 10-20 times longer than
the serum half-life of any other protein scaffold of comparable molecular
weight. Here we present data on the isolation and characterization of
high affinity ABDURIN binders to the cancer target EphA2. -Sarcin is a
small (17 kDa) fungal ribonuclease produced by Aspergillus giganteus.
Sarcin functions by catalytically cleaving a single phosphodiester bond
in the sarcin-ricin loop, a well-defined RNA motif within the rRNA
scaffold of the large ribosomal subunit. This cleavage makes the ribosome
unrecognizable to elongation factors and hence, blocks protein synthesis.
We have deimmunized -sarcin (Sarcin-DI) and made several variants lacking
T cell epitopes while retaining cytotoxic activity. This novel Abdurin
EphA2 binder fusion with Sarcin-DI creates a new generation of targeted
toxins with a longer half-life, low immunogenicity and potent tumor cell
killing.
