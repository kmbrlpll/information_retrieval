Title: Arming a tumor targeted oncolytic herpes simplex sirus type 1 with
matrix metalloproteinase 9 for enhanced vector distribution and killing
activity


Early phase human clinical trials using several versions of oncolytic
herpes simplex virus type 1 (oHSV) have shown promise in the treatment of
GBM, but efficacy has been limited. Impediments to oHSV therapy include
poor virus spread due in part to the tumor extracellular matrix, and
insufficient replication in tumor cells as a result of attenuating
mutations. Thus, the central goal of this project is to improve oncolytic
vector delivery, replication and spread while maintaining safety and
tumor specificity. We have already developed a new class of two stage
tumor targeted oHSV combining (i) selective infection through
tumor-specific receptors and (ii) selective replication based on
differential expression of microRNAs (miRs) in tumor and normal cells. We
further modify our vector by arming with the matrix metalloproteinase 9
(MMP9) as a means to reduce vector trapping in the tumor extracellular
matrix. Here we show that MMP9 expression (i) enhances Oncolytic vector
spreading in GBM neruospheres in vitro and (ii) improves tumor killing in
a xenogeneic model of primary human GBM with significant long-term
survival (50%) comparable to the control.
