Title: PDAC cells release BAG3 that activates a paracrine loop with
stromal macrophages


Interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells are critically
involved in tumor formation, progression and development of metastasis.
Here we report for the first time that human pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) cells secrete BAG3 that binds and activates macrophages, inducing
their activation and the secretion of pancreatic cancer- supporting
factors. We also identify IFITM-2 as a BAG3 receptor, by its
co-precipitation with BAG3 from macrophage cell membrane and by
impairment of BAG3- induced activation in IFITM-2- silenced macrophages.
Finally we show the importance of this pathway in vivo since in nu/nu
mice carrying orthotopic xenografts of human PDAC (MIA PaCa-2) cells,
BAG3 sequestration by an anti-BAG3 antibody results in reduced tumor
growth and prevents metastastasis formation. In conclusion we have
identified a novel paracrine loop involved in PDAC growth and metastatic
spreading and shown that its pharmacological blockage with an anti-BAG3
antibody has therapeutic potential.
