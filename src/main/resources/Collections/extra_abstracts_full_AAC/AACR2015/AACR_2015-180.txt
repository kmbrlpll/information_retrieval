Title: Expanding the definition of core binding factor leukemia


The core binding factor (CBF) transcription factor complex regulates
coding and non-coding genes that play a critical role in hematopoiesis.
Chromosomal rearrangements involving the two CFB subunits, RUNX1 and CFB
beta, are common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The fusion proteins
resulting from these rearrangements deregulate the transcription of
RUNX1-target genes, including microRNAs critical for KIT-mediated
proliferation (e.g. miR-221) and myeloid differentiation (e.g. miR-223).
We found that overexpression of miR-17, which downregulates RUNX1 level
by targeting RUNX1-UTR, recapitulates the biological effects of CBF-AML
fusion proteins by affecting the transcription of common coding and
non-coding RUNX1-targets. Consistently, increased levels of miR-17 can be
detected in AML patient samples displaying increased KIT level, but
without evidence of CBF mutations. Based on these finding, we propose
that the definition of CBF-AML leukemia can be expanded to accommodate
leukemia induced not only by genetic factors but also epigenetic factors,
such as microRNAs targeting RUNX1.Acknowledgements: Funding for this
