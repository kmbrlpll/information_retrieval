Title: Interpreting and navigating the TCGA in the context of the RAS
pathway


Analysis of large cancer data sets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) has demonstrated
the involvement of members of the RAS signaling pathway across many
different tumor types. In particular, KRAS mutations occur at high
frequency in lung, colorectal and particularly pancreatic tumors. Here,
we report an analysis of TCGA data examining several aspects of KRAS and
RAS pathway biology in the context several of the different data types
collected through TCGA. The findings include: A survey of the expression
of the KRAS alternatively spliced isoforms across all of the available
tumor types Enrichment analysis from differentially expressed genes from
high and low expressing samples for the 4A isoform (or the 4A/4B ratio)
Survival analysis for RAS pathway genes in the context of mutational and
expression level status Analysis of mutations in genes from the RAS
pathway across samples and tumor types Together, these findings
demonstrate that large data sets like TCGA can be used to reveal novel
insights into the function of key genes that play a role in the
development, maintenance and progression of cancer.
