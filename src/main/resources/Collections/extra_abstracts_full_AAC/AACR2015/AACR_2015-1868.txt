Title: Expression of MAS1 in triple-negative breast cancer


MAS1 is a receptor for angiotensin 1-7 (A1-7), which is derived from
angiotensin II (A-II) by the action of angiotensin converting enzyme
(ACE) 2. We examined the role of MAS1 in 132 cases of invasive ductal
carcinoma (IDC) of the breast by using immunohistochemistry. While normal
mammary tissues expressed MAS1 at high levels, MAS1 expression was
attenuated in all IDCs, especially in scirrhous IDCs. The decrease in
MAS1 expression was associated with tumor growth, lymph node metastasis,
and grade. MAS1 expression was inversely associated with the
proliferation index and epidermal growth factor receptor and human
epidermal growth factor receptor-2 expression. Of the 132 cases, 12
(9.1%) were triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cases. Using the mouse
TNBC cell line 4T1, which expresses MAS1, we found that cell growth,
anti-apoptotic survival, and invasion were suppressed by A1-7 treatment
and enhanced by MAS1 knockdown. Combination treatment with cisplatin, an
ACE2 activator, and an A-II type 1 receptor blocker showed synergic
effects on tumor growth inhibition. These findings suggest that MAS1
might be a pivotal molecular target for TNBC.Note: This abstract was not
