Title: Risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by race/ ethnicity
in the United States


Background: Primary liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer
worldwide, with HCC representing the majority of the cases. In the U.S.,
HCC rates are higher among Hispanics, Asians and blacks than among
whites. Whether the higher risks are due to different distributions of
risk factors is not clear. Thus, we conducted an analysis of HCC risk
factors by race/ethnicity in the SEER-Medicare database for the years
2000-2009.Methods: HCC cases (n = 8,116), identified by ICD-O morphology
codes 8170-8175, were compared to a 5% random sample of cancer-free
persons in the SEER areas (n = 313,525). Risk factors examined included
type II diabetes (DM II), obesity, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C
virus (HCV), alcohol-related disorders. Multivariate logistic regression
analyses, which adjusted for age, location, gender, income and date of
diagnosis as well as the other risk factors were used to compare risk
factors by racial/ethnic group.Results:Risk factors by race/ethnicityNOS
not otherwise specified.Conclusion: Major HCC risk factor profile is
differ across race/ethnical groups. While diabetes is most common risk
factor overall, it is most prevalent in Hispanics. HCC related to HCV is
more common in blacks and Asians, and to HBV in Asians.
