Title: Genome-wide analysis of stroma-tumor crosstalk pathways in lung
cancer: therapeutic implications


We have systematically dissected the microenvironmental hetereogeneity of
lung adenocarcinomas, and provide cellular and molecular landscapes that
contribute to carcinogenesis. RNA deep sequencing analysis of
individually sorted stromal and tumor epithelial compartments from fresh
clinical specimens and a mouse model of KrasG12D; p53-/- tumors
identified cell type-specific differentially regulated genes, indicative
of tumor activated/reprogrammed stroma. We developed a computational
crosstalk discovery algorithm to model crosstalk signaling discovery
based on ligand-receptor interactions and downstream signaling networks,
and identified novel tumor-stroma paracrine and tumor autocrine crosstalk
signaling pathways in the lung cancer microenvironment. We have explored
the mechanistic basis of selected crosstalk pathways including HGF-MET,
IL6-Stat3, Tsp-1-CD36, MMP14-HB-EGF in conferring lung adenocarcinoma
progression and in mediating therapeutic resistance, and have used both
genetic and pharmacological approaches to block these pathways. This
study has the potential for development of therapeutic strategies that
target tumor-stroma interactions, and may complement conventional
anti-cancer treatments.
