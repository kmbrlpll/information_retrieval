Title: Structural basis for inhibition of ligand-dependent and
-independent ErbB3 activation by KTN3379


ErbB3 signaling plays an important role in the progression of a number of
solid tumor types, and is the target of several therapeutic monoclonal
antibodies. In cancer, ErbB3 activation can be driven by its ligand
Neuregulin, or in its absence, through high overexpression of its
co-receptor ErbB2. Here, we report that the ErbB3 monoclonal antibody
KTN3379, currently in phase 1 clinical development, robustly inhibits
both mechanisms of ErbB3 activation in different tumor model settings.
The crystal structure of a KTN3379 Fab in complex with the full ErbB3
extracellular domain reveals that the antibody binds with very high
affinity to a novel and unique epitope in the boundary of domains 2 and
3, and locks the receptor in an inactive conformation. Thus, KTN3379
interferes with the first step of ErbB3 activation, which is required for
both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent signaling. The mechanism of
inhibition described here should be also applicable to EGFR and ErbB4.
