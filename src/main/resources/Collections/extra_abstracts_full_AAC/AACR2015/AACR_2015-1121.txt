Title: Analysis of gene expression changes as a function of PBRM1, BAP1,
and SETD2 mutation status clear cell renal cell carcinoma in TCGA tumors


In addition to VHL, the most commonly mutated clear cell renal cell
carcinoma (ccRCC)genes are the chromatin modifiers PBRM1, BAP1, and
SETD2. Mutations in these genes predict loss-of-function and presumably
exert cancer-related functions through changes in chromatin context and
gene expression. Mining publicly available data from The Cancer Genome
Anatomy (TCGA) allowed us to correlate mutation status and gene
expression profiles, potentially suggesting roles for these mutations in
ccRCC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)reveals that specific signaling
and metabolic changes are common for each tumor mutation and may reveal
the biologic mechanism of tumor-associated mutations. Work is underway to
functionally validate the effect of loss-of-function ccRCC mutations in
epigenetic modifiers.
