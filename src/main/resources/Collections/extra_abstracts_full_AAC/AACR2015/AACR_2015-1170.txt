Title: TTP inhibits insulin receptor signals in cancer cell


Insulin receptors (IRs) belong to the large class of tyrosine kinase
receptors and are activated by insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II and. The binding of
ligands to the IR initiates a cascade of events leading to activation of
signal transduction pathways, mainly PI3K and AKT pathways, and induce
glucose uptake and cell proliferation. IR signaling pathway has been
reported to be deregulated in cancer cells resulting in a range of
clinical manifestations including cancer. It has been shown that the
presence of IR was required for transformation induced by many oncogenes
and over-expression or constitutive activation of IR gave rise to
transformed phenotypes. Here, we report an unexpected role of a tumor
suppressor tristetraprolin (TTP) in inhibiting IR. TTP bound to the
AU-rich element (ARE) within the mRNA 3UTRs of IR, enhanced the decay of
their mRNAs and inhibited the metabolism of cancer cells. The ectopic
expression of IR without their 3UTRs blocked the inhibitory effects of
TTP on the Warburg effect cancer. Our data propose a new model whereby
the TTP down-regulates IR and plays an important role as a negative
regulator of both the energy metabolism and proliferation of cancer cells.
