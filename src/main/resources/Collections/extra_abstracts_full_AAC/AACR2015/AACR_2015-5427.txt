Title: Small molecule inhibitors of Musashi family of RNA-binding proteins


Musashi family of RNA-binding proteins are key regulators of several stem
cell populations and are also involved in tumor proliferation and
maintenance. There are two Musashi proteins in humans, Msi1 and Msi2,
both of which regulate target mRNAs translation. We aim to identify small
molecule inhibitors of Msi activity thus blocking the growth of a broad
range of cancer cells. Known mRNA targets of Msi1 include Numb, APC and
p21WAF-1, key regulators of Notch, Wnt signaling and cell cycle
progression, respectively. Numb is also an mRNA target of Msi2. We
confirmed the binding between numb and Msi1/Msi2 by RNA-IP. Using a
fluorescence polarization assay, we screened small molecules from several
chemical libraries for those that disrupt the binding of Msi1 to its
consensus RNA binding site. Hits were validated by surface plasmon
resonance, amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assays and nuclear
magnetic resonance. Among the small molecules that we screened, we found
several hit compounds that disrupt the Msi1-numb RNA binding potently.
Our study supports the hypothesis that Msi1 inhibition is a viable and
effective anti-cancer strategy and we identified (-)-gossypol as the
first small molecule inhibitor of Msi1 that inhibits tumor xenograft
growth in vivo.
