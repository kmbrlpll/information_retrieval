Title: Melatonin inhibits stemness of glioblastoma cancer stem-like cells
via regulation of histone methylation


The pineal gland hormone melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is well
known as an anticancer effector. Recently, a variety of studies have
shown that melatonin induces apoptosis in various cancer cell types such
as colon cancer, Ewing sarcoma, hepatic cancer, prostate cancer and
breast cancer cells. Glioblastoma cancer stem-like cells (GCSLC) are the
most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. In the present
study, we found that melatonin significantly decreased the sphere
formation of GCSLC, and attenuated the expression of c-Myc genes.
Furthermore, melatonin suppressed expression of H3K4me3 and H3K79me3
around c-Myc promoter region by Western blotting and Chip assay. Of note,
melatonin suppressed the expression of several stemness markers including
nestin in GCSLC. Overall, our findings suggest melatonin as a potent
anticancer stem cell agent for GCSLC.
