Title: CEACAM6 promotes tumor angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry in
gastric cancer via FAK signaling


CEACAM6 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked immunoglobulin
superfamily member that is implicated in a variety of human cancers. In
our previous study, we reported that CEACAM6 was overexpressed in gastric
cancer (GC) tissues and promoted cancer metastasis. The purpose of this
study is to determine the role of CEACAM6 in tumor angiogenesis and
vasculogenic mimicry (VM). We found that overexpression of CEACAM6
promoted tubular formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) and VM formation in GC. While opposing results were achieved in
CEACAM6 knock-down groups. Interestingly, we found that mosaic vessels
formed by HUVECs and GCs were observed in vitro by 3D-culture. Moreover,
overexpression of CEACAM6 in GCs promoted tumor growth, VEGF secretion
and VM structures in vivo. In accordance with these observations, we
found that phosphorylation of FAK and phosphorylation of paxillin were
up-regulated in CEACAM6-overexpressing GCs, and FAK inhibitor Y15 could
reduce tube and VM formation. These findings suggest that CEACAM6
promotes tumor angiogenesis and VM may via FAK signaling, and CEACAM6
maybe a new potential target for cancer anti-vascular treatment.
