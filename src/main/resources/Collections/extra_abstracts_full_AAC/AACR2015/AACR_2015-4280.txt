Title: Utilizing a selective agonist of the intermediate-affinity IL-2
receptor with an improved pharmacokinetic profile leads to an enhanced
immunostimulatory response With reduced toxicity in mice


RDB 1450 is an engineered fusion protein which selectively activates the
intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor present on NK cells and memory CD8 T
cells. In rodents, RDB 1450 has a half-life of 6-8 hours, compared to a
half-life of minutes for recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2). Repeat daily
dosing (QD) of RDB 1450 in mice results in marked expansion of NK cells
and CD8+CD44high T cells, with minimal expansion of CD4+ regulatory T
cells (Tregs). Higher QD doses elicit more pronounced effector cell
expansion with modest pulmonary edema. TID delivery of the same total
daily dose of RDB 1450 enhances the immunological responses in the
absence of pulmonary edema. These results suggest that prolonged delivery
of reduced concentrations of RDB 1450 drive the desired immune responses
with improved tolerability. In contrast, high circulating concentrations
of rhIL-2 are required to stimulate effector cells due to its
preferential activation of Tregs at lower concentrations. The selectivity
profile and favorable pharmacokinetics of RDB 1450 highlight its
potential as a novel, differentiated immunotherapeutic agent for the
treatment of cancer.
