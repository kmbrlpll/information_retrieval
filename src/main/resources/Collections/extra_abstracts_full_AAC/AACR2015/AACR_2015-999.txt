Title: Utilization of catastrophic autophagy in ovarian cancer


In ovarian cancer, the dysfunction of apoptotic effectors such as p53
suggests that therapies which act tangential to apoptotic pathways may
offer alternative avenues to target recalcitrant disease. These pathways
include necroptosis, ER stress, and autophagy. Evaluating combinations of
agents which impact these pathways, we found that effects of non-toxic
drugs that induced ER stress and autophagy were potentiated when used
with drugs that prevented autophagy resolution. At the cellular level,
LC3-II levels were elevated in response to these agents, and predicted
efficacy. GRP78 and SQSTM1/p62 were similarly elevated, indicating
induction of the ER stress pathway impaired autophagic flux,
respectively. The resulting death, via catastrophic autophagy, may be an
effective way to target traditional-chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer.
