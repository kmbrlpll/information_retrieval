Title: The role of MYST4 in ovarian carcinoma


Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) play critical roles in the process of
cell growth and development. However, little is known about the
relationship between MYST4, a known HAT, and human tumors. In our
previous studies, we found that MYST4 was overexpressed in ovarian
high-grade serous carcinomas and patients with tumors overexpressing
MYST4 had significantly worse survival. To explore the role of MYST4 in
ovarian carcinoma, we built up stable ovarian cancer cell lines with
MYST4 knockdown by shRNA. By cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry,
we found that MYST4 enhanced cancer cell growth and regulated cell cycle
progression. In addition, the migration distance was significantly
decreased in MYST4 knockdown cell lines, suggesting that MYST4 promotes
cellular migration. Further cDNA microarray revealed several target genes
that were down-regulated by MYST4 knockdown, some have been reported to
be involved in tumorigenesis and aggressive tumor behavior. Together, our
study suggests that MYST4 promotes cancer cell growth and migration.
Overexpression of MYST4 in cancer cells may contribute to tumors toward a
more aggressive behavior. Thus, MYST4 may serve as a potential target in
treating ovarian carcinomas overexpressing MYST4.
