Title: Medi3622, a monoclonal antibody to ADAM17, inhibits tumor growth
by inhibiting EGFR- and non-EGFR-mediated pathways


ADAM17 is the primary sheddase for HER pathway ligands. We report the
discovery of a potent and specific ADAM17 inhibitory antibody, MEDI3622,
which induces tumor regression or stasis in many EGFR-dependent tumor
models. The inhibitory activity of MEDI3622 correlated with EGFR activity
both in a series of tumor models across several indications as well as in
a focused set of head and neck patient derived xenograft models.
Cynomolgus monkey and rat PK/PD assays showed MEDI3622 inhibited TNF
shedding. Toxicity observed in cynomolgus monkey and rat was similar to
EGFR inhibitor-induced rash. However, the antitumor activity of MEDI3622
was superior to that of EGFR/HER pathway inhibitors in OE21 head and neck
and COLO205 colorectal xenograft models suggesting additional activity
outside of the EGFR pathway. Combination of MEDI3622 and cetuximab in the
OE21 model was additive and eradicated tumors. Proteomics analysis
revealed novel ADAM17 substrates which function outside of the HER
pathways and may contribute towards the antitumor activity of the
monoclonal antibody.
