Title: Development of Bcl2 BH4 antagonist for cancer therapy


The BH4 domain of Bcl2 is required for its antiapoptotic function, thus
constituting a promising anticancer target. We identified a novel small
molecule Bcl2-BH4 domain-antagonist (BDA-366) that binds BH4 with high
affinity and selectivity. BDA-366-Bcl2 binding induces conformational
change in Bcl2 that abrogates its antiapoptotic function, converting it
from a survival to a cell death inducer. BDA-366 induces regression of
lung cancer xenografts derived from cell line and patient without
significant normal tissue toxicity at effective doses. mTOR inhibition
up-regulates Bcl2 in lung cancer cells and tumor tissues from clinical
trial patients. Combined BDA-366 and RAD001 treatment exhibits strong
synergy against lung cancer in vivo. Development of this Bcl2-BH4
antagonist may provide a novel strategy to improve lung cancer outcome.
