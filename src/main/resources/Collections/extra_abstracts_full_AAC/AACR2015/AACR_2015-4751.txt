Title: Simple modifications in Ion Torrent Variant Caller (TVC)
parameters improve somatic variant detection from circulating tumor cells
and cell free DNA to 1% allele frequency


By increasing quality-associated parameters and lowering sensitivity
thresholds, a significant improvement in low frequency allele detection
was achieved. The approach described was optimized using a dilution
series of synthetic spike-ins (the AcroMetrix Oncology Hotspot Control),
and a titrated range of tumor cell lines in a normal background. The
optimized variant calling approach was then applied to the analysis of
somatic variants in circulating tumor cell (CTC) samples and associated
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Libraries
were produced using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 for coverage
of 50 cancer-associated genes and 2,800 COSMIC mutations. Using the above
samples, the improved somatic variant detection workflow demonstrated
analytical sensitivity down to 1% allele ratio in the observed sequence
reads.
