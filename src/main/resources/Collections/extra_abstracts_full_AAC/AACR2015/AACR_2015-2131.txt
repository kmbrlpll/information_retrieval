Title: The Arkadia-ESRP2 axis suppresses tumor progression: Analyses in
clear cell renal cell carcinoma


Tumor-specific alternative splicing is implicated in the progression of
cancer, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a major
subtype of kidney cancer accounting for 70-80% of all kidney cancer
patients. Using ccRCC RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas,
we found that epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 (ESRP2), one of
the key regulators of alternative splicing in epithelial cells, is
expressed in ccRCC, while ESRP1 is decreased in most of the ccRCC as
previously reported. ESRP2 mRNA expression did not correlate with the
overall survival rate of ccRCC patients, but the expression of some
ESRP-target exons, including ENAH exon 11a, ITGA6 exon 27, and SLK exon
13, correlated with the good prognosis and with the expression of Arkadia
(also known as RNF111) in ccRCC. Arkadia, a RING-type E3 ligase, that is
known to enhance TGF- signaling activities, physically interacted with
ESRP2, induced polyubiquitination, and modulated its splicing function.
Arkadia and ESRP2 suppressed ccRCC tumor growth in a coordinated manner.
Lower expression of Arkadia correlated with advanced tumor stages and
poor outcomes in ccRCC patients. This study thus reveals a novel
tumor-suppressive role of the Arkadia-ESRP2 axis in ccRCC.
