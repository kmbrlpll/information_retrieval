Title: Cell-based screening identifies gene expression signature
correlated with sensitivity to PI3K-mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ235


The PI3K-mTOR pathway is one of the major signaling cascades that promote
tumor growth and cell survival. Multiple inhibitors targeting this
important axis are currently under clinical investigation for cancer
treatment and some are under preclinical development. Here we examined
the anti-proliferation activity of BEZ235, a PI3K and mTOR dual
inhibitor, in 243 human cancer cell lines of different caner types. We
identified 35 lines that are sensitive to the inhibitor with IC50 values
less than 0,04uM and 57 insensitive lines with IC50 values more than
0.4uM. We compared gene expression of the two groups by Affymetrix U219
arrays. With a p-value cutoff set at 0.00001, we identified 14 genes that
are differentially expressed. These genes include epithelial membrane
glycoprotein EPCAM and serine threonine kinase 31 (STK31). Furthermore,
the mutation status of tubulin tyrosine ligase TTL is significantly
correlated with sensitivity to BEZ235. These results suggested a
potential genomic signature that could be predictive of response to
BEZ235 and provided information that may help selecting patients that are
likely to receive clinical benefit.
