Title: RNA-Seq profiling of silibinin effects on bladder cancer cells


Silibinin is the major active constituent of silymarin, an extract of the
milk thistle seeds, containing a mixture of flavonolignans such as
silibinin and isosilibinin. Silibinin has been shown to have significant
anti-cancer effects in a variety of cancer types, including bladder,
kidney, prostate, skin, breast, lung and colon cancer. Silibinin (10 M)
significantly suppressed proliferation and invasion of T24 and UM-UC-3
bladder cancer cells. Western blot analysis showed that silibinin
significantly reduces expression of vimentin and slug in these bladder
cells. Vimentin is overexpressed in various cancers and is known to
promote tumor growth, invasion, and poor prognosis. Slug, a
transcriptional repressor which mediates epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT), has been implicated in tumor metastasis. These results
indicate that silibinin inhibits proliferation and invasion by
suppressing vimentin and slug in bladder cancer cells. We studed the
anti-cancer effects of silibinin in bladder cancer cells using RNA-Seq, a
transcriptome profiling technique that uses deep-sequencing to
quantitatively investigate the global behavior of transcriptomes. We will
discuss the RNA-Seq profiling of the anti-cancer effects of silibinin in
bladder cancer cells, including the vimentin and slug networks.
