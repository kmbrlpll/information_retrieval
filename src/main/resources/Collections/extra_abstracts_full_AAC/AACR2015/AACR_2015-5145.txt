Title: Y-27632 inhibits Myc-induced apoptosis and cooperates with Myc to
immortalize human keratinocytes


The high-risk HPV E6 and E7 genes are sufficient to immortalize human
foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) through activation of telomerase and
inactivation of the RB/p16 pathway, respectively. Our previous work has
shown that Myc (via induction of hTERT) may substitute for E6 and
immortalize HFKs when combined with HPV E7. When expressed alone,
however, Myc induced p53 expression and apoptosis. In the current study
we found that Myc, in combination with the ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632), led
immortalization of human foreskin keratinocytes. Our data confirmed that
Myc induced apoptosis and blebbing of human keratinocytes when cultured
in serum free synthetic medium (KGM) and that Y-27632 rapidly inhibits
this process. Thus, our data demonstrate that Myc is capable of
independently immortalizing HFKs when apoptosis pathways are blocked.
