Title: Virotherapy with a Semliki Forest virus-based vector encoding
IL-12 synergizes with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade


Virotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors can be combined for the treatment
of cancer with complementarity and potential for synergistic effects. We
have developed a cytolytic but non-replicative viral vector system based
on Semliki Forest virus that encodes IL-12 (SFV-IL-12). Following direct
intratumoral injection, infected cells release transgenic IL-12, die and
elicit an inflammatory response triggered by both abundantly copied viral
RNA and IL-12. In difficult to treat mouse cancer models, such as those
derived from MC38 and bilateral B16-OVA, SFV-IL-12 synergized with an
anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to induce tumor regression and
prolong survival. Similar synergistic effects were attained upon PD-L1
blockade. Combined SFV-IL-12 + anti-PD-1 mAb treatment only marginally
increased the elicited CTL response over SFV-IL-12 as a single agent, at
least when measured by in vivo killing assays. In contrast, we observed
that SFV-IL-12 treatment induced expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells in an
IFN-dependent fashion. PD-L1-mediated adaptive resistance thereby
provides a mechanistic explanation of the observed synergistic effects
achieved by the SFV-IL-12 + anti-PD-1 mAb combination.
