Title: An ER-36 monoclonal antibody exhibits anticancer activity in
triple-negative breast cancer cells


ER-36 is a novel variant of ER-, plays an important role in mitogenic
estrogen signaling and tamoxifen resistance in both ER-positive and
-negative breast cancer. ER-36 is highly expressed on the plasma membrane
of both ER-positive and -negative breast cancer stem/progenitor cells and
critical for maintenance of the breast cancer stem/progenitor cells,
which make it a promising target for antibody-based breast cancer
treatment. In this study, we have screened and identified a candidate of
therapeutic antibody named 3C11 that specifically recognizes ER-36 at its
unique C-terminal residues. The antibody 3C11 showed pM affinity to ER-36
in the BiaCore assay and potent growth inhibitory activity in multiple
breast cancer cell lines in vitro. In addition, 3C11 also showed
dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in a xenograft model formed by
a triple-negative breast cancer cell line SUM159 that was generated from
a refractory breast cancer. Furthermore, we found that 3C11 was quickly
and efficiently internalized into cells, which makes it a potential
candidate for development of the antibody-drug conjugate approaches.
These results demonstrated that ER-36 is promising cancer target for
development of antibody-based therapeutic approaches.
