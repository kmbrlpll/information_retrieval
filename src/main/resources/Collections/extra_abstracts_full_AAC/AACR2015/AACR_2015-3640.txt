Title: Discovery of quinazolinones as fibroblast growth factor receptor
(FGFR1-4) kinase inhibitors


Recent data obtained in several tumor types have identified Fibroblast
Growth Factor signaling as a key factor in the molecular pathology of a
number of cancers1. This has stimulated the development of a number of
agents that block this pathway, including FGFR kinase inhibitors with
diverse inhibition and pharmacological profiles that are currently being
evaluated in clinical studies.We recently reported that a quinoxaline
moiety can efficiently bind the hinge region of FGFR kinase catalytic
sites. In continuation of our efforts to discover additional FGFR1-4
inhibitors, we have identified a quinazolinone scaffold as a novel FGFR
kinase hinge binder. Initial hits were optimized into compounds
displaying nanomolar affinity for FGFR1-4, potent activity in FGFR driven
cells and efficacy in a Ba/F3-FGFR3 xenograft model.This report
represents the first disclosure of the structure-activity relationships
as well as the chemical synthesis pathways of these novel
quinazolinone-based FGFR1-4 inhibitors.Turner N. and Grose R. Nature
