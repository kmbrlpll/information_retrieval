Title: Dihydrotanshione I induces caspase-independent cell death and
autophagy in lung cancer cells


In the present study the antitumor mechanism of dihydrotanshinone I (DHT)
from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge was elucidated in lung cancer cells. DHT
significantly exerted cytotoxicity and increased the apoptosis by Annexin
V assay in NSCLC (A549 and H460 cells) and lung mesothelioma cells (H28,
H2452, MSTO). Furthermore, DHT reduced clonogenic ability in A549 cells.
Interestingly, DHT increased PARP cleavage, but no activation of
caspase-9 and caspase-3, although caspase-8 and, 3 were partially
activated. FACS analysis revealed that the pan-caspase inhibitor
z-VAD-fmk increased apoptosis induced by DHT. Furthermore, MTT assay
showed that z-VAD-fmk treatment did not block cell cytotoxicity induced
by DHT. In contrast, DHT induced the features of autophagy, including
formation of autophagosomes by immunofluorescence and an increase of
LC3II level after DHT exposure. Treatment of 3MA, an inhibitor of
autophagy, blocked the expression level of LC3II induced by DHT and
induced cytoprotective autophagy in A549 cells. Taken together, our data
suggest that DHT induces caspase-independent cell death and autophagy in
lung cancer cells as a potent agent for lung cancer treatment.
