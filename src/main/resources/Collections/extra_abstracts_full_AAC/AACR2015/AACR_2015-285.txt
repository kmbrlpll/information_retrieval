Title: MEDI9447: enhancing anti-tumor immunity by targeting CD73 In the
tumor microenvironment


MEDI9447 is a monoclonal antibody specific for the ectoenzyme, CD73. Data
is presented in support of the hypothesis that targeting the
extracellular production of adenosine by CD73 reduces the
immunosuppressive effects of adenosine. We report a range of activities
for this antibody, including inhibition of both recombinant and cellular
CD73 ectonucleotidase activity, relief from AMP-mediated lymphocyte
suppression in vitro, and inhibition of syngeneic tumor growth. In
contrast with many other cancer immunotherapy agents such as checkpoint
inhibitors or T cell agonists, MEDI9447 drives changes in both myeloid
and lymphoid infiltrating leukocyte populations within the tumor
microenvironment. Changes include significant increases in CD8 effector
cells and activated macrophages, as well as a reduction in the
proportions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T
lymphocytes. Furthermore, these changes correlate directly with responder
and non-responder subpopulations within the arms of animal studies using
syngeneic tumors. Data showing additive activity between MEDI9447 and
other immune-mediated therapy antibodies demonstrates the importance of
relieving adenosine-mediated immunosuppression within tumors.
