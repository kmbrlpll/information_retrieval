Title: MicroRNA markers for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer


It is recently reported that microRNAs (miRNAs) are stably present in
serum and potentially useful in the diagnosis of cancer. Using highly
sensitive microarray, 3D-Gene, we examined comprehensive miRNA expression
profiles in serum obtained from 66 pancreatic cancer patients and 100
matched healthy volunteer as the study set, and found that 122 miRNA
markers differentiated pancreatic cancer patients from healthy control
with a statistical significance. We then validated the diagnostic
performance of these markers using serum obtained from 33 pancreatic
cancer patients and 50 healthy controls. One of the single miRNA markers
for pancreatic cancer yielded more than 90% diagnostic sensitivity and
specificity, and combined use of two markers perfectly differentiated
cancer and healthy samples. Furthermore, combinations of miRNAs that
differentiated pancreatic cancer not only from healthy samples but also
from non-malignant pancreatic diseases or other digestive (esophagus,
stomach, liver and colon) cancers were also identified, and their
diagnostic accuracies were superior to those of CEA or CA19-9. Our
results suggest that these miRNA markers have clinical values to screen
out pancreatic cancer patients.
