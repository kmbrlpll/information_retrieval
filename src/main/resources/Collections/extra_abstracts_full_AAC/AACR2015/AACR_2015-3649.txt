Title: Broad profiling reveals opportunities for selective inhibition of
disease-associated mutant kinases


Small molecule kinase inhibitors are promising therapeutic agents in a
number of diseases, most notably cancer. However, mutations in kinases,
both intrinsic and acquired, can drastically alter inhibitor sensitivity.
To identify inhibitors of disease-associated mutant kinases, we conducted
an unbiased functional screen of 182 small molecule kinase inhibitors
against 76 mutated recombinant kinases arising from 21 cognate wild-type
kinases. The results revealed novel lead compounds that were exquisitely
selective for mutant kinases, including several that exhibited preferred
inhibition of mutant kinases over their cognate wild-type kinases. This
study provides a resource for the development of novel small molecule
inhibitors against disease-associated mutant kinases and illustrates the
potential of unbiased large-scale profiling as an approach to
compound-centric kinase inhibitor discovery.
