Title: The combination of CD40 agonism and PD-L1 blockade enhances
anti-tumor immunity in a mouse syngeneic orthotopic pancreatic tumor model


Infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells into tumors correlates
with poorer prognosis in many cancer types. The immunosuppressive effects
of these cells help to create a microenvironment that may inhibit
responses to T cell-directed immunotherapies. Anti-CD40 agonistic
antibodies (CD40) promote myeloid cell maturation, license
cross-presentation of antigens to cytotoxic T cells, and enhance direct
macrophage tumoricidal activity. We tested the hypothesis that CD40 can
improve responses to PD-L1 blockade via enhancing anti-tumor immunity in
a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer (Pan02). Whilst
PD-L1 blockade alone had limited effect on tumor growth, we demonstrated
that CD40 drove antigen presenting cell maturation and systemic immune
activation, inhibiting tumor growth and improving overall survival. CD40
also induced upregulation of PD-L1 both systemically and within the tumor
microenvironment. Furthermore, the combination of CD40 and PD-L1 blockade
led to enhanced tumor growth inhibition and improved anti-tumor immunity
compared to either monotherapy alone. These data provide further support
for the potential benefits of re-educating tumor myeloid cells.
