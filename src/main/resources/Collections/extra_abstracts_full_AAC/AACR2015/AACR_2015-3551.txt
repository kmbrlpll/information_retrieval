Title: A microRNA-1280/JAG2 network comprises a novel biological target
in high-risk medulloblastoma


Over-expression of PDGF receptors (PDGFRs) has been previously implicated
in high-risk medulloblastoma (MB) pathogenesis. However, the exact
biological functions of PDGFR and PDGFR signaling in MB biology remain
poorly understood. Here, we report the subgroup specific expression of
PDGFR and PDGFR and their associated biological pathways in MB tumors.
c-MYC, a downstream target of PDGFR but not PDGFR, is involved in PDGFR
signaling associated with cell proliferation, cell death, and invasion.
Concurrent inhibition of PDGFR and c-MYC blocks MB cell proliferation and
migration synergistically. Integrated analysis of miRNA and miRNA targets
regulated by both PDGFR and c-MYC reveals that increased expression of
JAG2, a target of miR-1280, is associated with high metastatic
dissemination at diagnosis and a poor outcome in MB patients. Our study
may resolve the controversy on the role of PDGFRs in MB and unveils JAG2
as a key downstream effector of a PDGFR-driven signaling cascade and a
potential therapeutic target.
