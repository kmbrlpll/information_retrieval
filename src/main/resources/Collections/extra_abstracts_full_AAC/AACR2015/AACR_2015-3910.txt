Title: Acetylation of Np63 by Tip60 affects its stability


p63, a member of the transcription factor p53 family, exists as six
different isoforms due to the usage of alternative promoter sites and
splicing. Np63 is the most abundant and predominant isoform and is
identified to being involved in epithelial morphogenesis. Np63 expression
is up-regulated in non-melanoma skin cancers. We have identified Np63 as
a potential target for acetylation by the Tat Interacting Protein 60 kDa
(TIP60) histone acetyltransferase (HAT) by mass spectometry.
Co-expression of Np63 with Tip60 leads to stabilization of Np63 protein
levels. The change in protein levels are not due to an increase in
transcription or translation, and is likely the result of stabilization
by post-translational modification as confirmed by half-life studies in
presence of cycloheximide and measurement of transcript levels by
quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. This was further supported by our
observations that Np63 and Tip60 interact using immunoprecipitation
studies. Np63 levels are not affected by Tip60 HAT mutant, but increased
with Tip60 double sumoylation mutant which retains its acetyltransferase
ability. These results identify a possible biologically important
interaction between Np63 and Tip60, warranting further investigation.
