Title: Regulation of RNA processing by PADI4 pathway


We recently reported that p53 regulated protein citrullination through
the transcriptional regulation of PADI4 that converts an arginine residue
in proteins to a citrulline residue. In response to DNA damage, p53-PADI4
pathway induced citrullination of NPM1, Histone H4, and Lamin C, and
subsequently promoted apoptotic pathway. To elucidate entire roles of
p53-PADI4 pathway, we screened novel targets by LC-MS analysis and found
that majority of hnRNP family members are citrullinated by ectopic
expression of PADI4. LC-MS analysis and specific antibody revealed
citrullination of hnRNP G at arginine 223 residue. In addition,
citrullination of hnRNP G inhibited interaction with RNA helicases or
other hnRNP family members. Citrullination motif analysis revealed the
enrichment of D, G, S, E, and A at -1 (56.0%), +1 (55.8%) and +2 (45.8%)
position. Since hnRNP family is involved in RNA processing, we conducted
RNA sequence analysis by using bone marrow from Padi4+/+ or Padi4-/-
mice. As a result, Padi4 was shown to alter the splicing pattern of
several genes. Moreover, Padi4-/-p53+/- mice exhibited significantly
shorter survival time compared with Padi4+/+p53+/- mice. Our finding
revealed a novel role of p53-PADI4 pathway in RNA splicing and human
carcinogenesis.
