Title: Plk1-mediated stabilization of 53BP1 suppresses centrosome
abnormal amplification


Mammalian Plk1 has been studied as an essential factor in regulating
mitotic events through the phosphorylation of several Plk1-specific
substrates. Here we show that in mitosis 53BP1 binds to the C-terminal
polo-box domain of Plk1 and is a substrate for Plk1 in vitro. 53BP1 is
hyper-phosphorylated and its level is up-regulated in cells expressing
wild type Plk1 (Plk1-WT), but not in cells expressing a kinase-defective
mutant (Plk1-KM). Depletion of Plk1 reduces the level of 53BP1 which is
restored in cells treated with MG132. In cells expressing Plk1-KM but not
in Plk1-WT cells, 53BP1 interacts with Mdm2 suggesting that 53BP1
turnover is regulated by Plk1-mediated phosphorylation. In mitosis, 53BP1
colocalizes with Plk1 to the centrosome and the spindle pole.
Down-regulation of 53BP1 by shRNA induces multiple centrioles, multiple
spindle poles, and mis-orientation of poles in HeLa cells. The data
suggest that the phosphorylation of 53BP1 by Plk1 regulates its
stability, and that this biochemical event plays a crucial role in
modulating chromosomal amplification which ensures bipolarity in mitosis.
