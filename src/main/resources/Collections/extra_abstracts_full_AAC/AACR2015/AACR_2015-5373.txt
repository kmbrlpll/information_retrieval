Title: AK-1, a specific SIRT2 inhibitor, induces cell cycle arrest by
downregulating Snail in HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells


SIRT2, a member of the sirtuin family, is involved in the regulation of a
variety of physiological functions. In addition, SIRT2 has been studied
in the context of pathological conditions including neurodegenerative
diseases, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. The effect of SIRT2 on cancer
cell growth depends on cancer tissue type. To investigate the role of
SIRT2 in colon cancer, we treated HCT116 human colon cancer cells with
the SIRT2-specific inhibitor AK-1, a cell-permeable benzylsulfonamide.
AK-1 treatment induced proteasomal degradation of the Snail transcription
factor through inactivation of the NF-B/CSN2 pathway. Reduction in the
level of Snail resulted in upregulation of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor, leading to G1 arrest, slow proliferation, and slow
wound-healing activity. The regulation of Snail-p21 axis by AK-1 also
occurs in HT-29 colon cancer cells. Therefore, inhibition of SIRT2 using
AK-1 would be a beneficial intervention in the treatment of colon cancer.
