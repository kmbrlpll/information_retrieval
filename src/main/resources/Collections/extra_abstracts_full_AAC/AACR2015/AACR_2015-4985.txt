Title: Notch1 as a key mediator in promoting advanced
castration-resistant prostate cancer


The first line of treatment for men with advanced prostate cancers is
androgen deprivation therapy. However, the disease commonly relapses in
its lethal metastatic form referred to as castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC). CRPC is the primary cause of prostate cancer specific
mortality in men. Current therapies including chemotherapeutic agents
improve median overall survival by only few months. The mechanisms that
distinguish clinically localized indolent tumors from lethal CRPC are
unclear. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of Notch1 promotes
progression to poorly differentiated carcinoma when combined with
pathways that are altered in advanced disease but are insufficient to
drive aggressive prostate cancer alone. Notch1 driven tumors are
resistant to androgen deprivation. Transcriptional profiling reveals that
these tumors display features of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a
morphological change associated with tumor aggressiveness and metastasis.
Our study provides the first functional evidence that Notch1 signaling
axis is a key mediator in promoting advanced prostate cancer and may
represent a new therapeutic target for the advanced disease.Note: This
