Title: Moving beyond in vitro models and addressing the challenges of
pooled RNAi screens in mouse xenografts


RNAi loss-of-function screening with pooled shRNA expression libraries
has proven to be a useful tool to identify essential cancer genes and
drug resistance mechanisms in numerous cell lines in vitro. The effects
of knocking down large numbers of genes on cancer cell growth and
viability can be measured simultaneously using this approach. Now there
is considerable interest to adapt RNAi viability screens to ex vivo
xenograft mouse models. However, small take rates, growth rate variance
of cells, and differing cell microenvironments in these more complex
tumor models impose significant challenges to this sort of assay. We have
developed a novel approach based on the use of pooled shRNA libraries
with clonal barcodes that enables proliferation measurements of clonal
populations produced by the individual shRNA-expressing founder cells
that produce the tumor. This RNAi clonal analysis provides a basis to
separate, across large cell populations, the external parameters that
strongly influence cell growth rates from shRNA-induced growth inhibition
in these systems. We will present in vivo RNAi screening validation data
for several cancer models.
