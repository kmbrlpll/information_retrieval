Title: Non-invasive analysis for T790M mutations of EGFR using a
selective amplification method


Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation is associated with
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) resistance in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). However, tissue availability limits the genotyping
of EGFR T790M mutation in a clinical setting. The aims of this study are
to develop a blood-based, non-invasive approach to detecting the
EGFRT790M mutation in advanced NSCLC patients, using PointMan EGFR DNA
Enrichment Kit, which is a novel method for selective amplification of
genotype specific sequences.Methods: Blood samples were collected from
NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations, who were resistant to
EGFR-TKIs treatment. EGFR T790M mutations in plasma DNA were detected
using the kit. The concentrations of plasma DNA were determined using
quantitative real-time PCR.Results: 21 (87.5%) of the patients had EGFR
T790M mutations in their plasma DNA as detected using the kit. In all 6
cases detected T790M mutations from tumor tissues, the T790M mutations
ware detected also in plasma DNA. The concentrations of plasma DNA were
higher in patients with T790M mutations than without the
mutations.Conclusions: The PointMan is an easily and useful method for
determining the plasma EGFR T790M mutation status.
