Title: The regulatory effect of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C in oral
squamous cell carcinoma progression


In previous studies, glycolysis machinery has been identified as a
regulating pathway in cancer cell. However, the role of glycolysis in
oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) progression is still largely unknown.
Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C (ALDOC), one of the key enzymes in
glycolysis, expresses in OSCC patients and cell lines and detects by
real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The functions of ALDOC were determined by
gain and loss function approaches and the orthotopic animal model was
performed. ALDOC mRNA and protein expression was significantly decreased
in advanced migratory cell and negatively correlated with lymph node
metastasis and advanced tumor TNM stage in OSCC patients. In conclusion,
ALDOC plays as an OSCC prognosis marker clinically, and functions to
suppress OSCC cell migration and invasion. ALDOC could be a potential
therapeutic target to block OSCC progression.
