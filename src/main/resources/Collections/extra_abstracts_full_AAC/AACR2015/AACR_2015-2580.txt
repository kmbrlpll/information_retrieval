Title: Screening of a mixture-based synthetic combinatorial library
identifies small molecules that inhibit the ability of GTP to displace
mant-GDP from mutant G12D KRas


Although mutant KRas significantly contributes to human oncogenesis and
patient tumor resistance to therapy, there are no anticancer drugs
directly targeting mt KRas available in clinic. A major effort in our
laboratory is to identify novel compounds that bind mt KRas and inhibit
potently and selectively KRas-driven malignant transformation. To this
end, we have used a mixture-based synthetic combinatorial library
(scaffold ranking library) containing over 6 million compounds in a
mant-GDP assay to identify chemical scaffolds that inhibit the ability of
GTP to displace mant-GDP from mt G12D KRas. Subsequent screening of the
positional scanning libraries derived from the hit mixtures led to
several individual compound hits with the most potent inhibiting the
ability of GTP to displace mant-GDP from mt G12D KRas with IC50 of 61 M.
Current studies are focused on physical characterization of the hits to
mt KRas and cellular activities of these hits in mt KRas-dependent and
-independent human cancer cell lines.
