Title: CCR6-mediated molecular mechanisms involved in colon cancer


Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of death due to cancer
worldwide. Molecular mechanism of initiation and progression of this
disease is yet to be defined. Chemokines and their corresponding
receptors have been shown to play important role in progression of many
cancers including colon. In this study we have demonstrated that CCR6 is
highly expressed in colon cancer and is associated with key steps of
metastasis. Cell migration, adhesion and invasion are the key features of
cancer progression. This process initiates with the change of less motile
epithelial phenotype to a more motile mesenchymal type, the phenomenon
known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Interestingly,
stimulation of colon cancer cell with CCL20, which is the only natural
ligand for CCR6, showed significant decrease in E-cadherin. Furthermore,
increased Vimentin, beta-Catenin, N-cadherin, alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin
(SMA) and Snail following CCL20 treatment implicates potential role of
CCR6-CCL20 axis in transition to mesenchymal phenotype. Hence, strategies
directed to this chemokine-receptor axis may improve therapeutic outcome
of colon cancer.
