Title: Mesenchymal stem cell as delivery carrier for prodrug gene therapy
against colorectal cancer cell


Gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) is an approach that delivers
a suicidal gene to cancer cells for the expression of prodrug-activating
enzyme which converts prodrug into cytotoxic drug. One of the major
impediments of GDEPT is to have the therapeutic gene specifically target
on cancer cells prior to the administration of prodrug. Among various
gene delivery methods, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as
potential carriers for gene delivery. They exhibit remarkable
tumor-tropic and low immunogenic capacities. In this study, MSCs was
engineered to express thymidine phosphorylase (TP) which has the
capability of converting the prodrug doxifluridine into toxic
5-fluorouracil. TP expression in the MSCs post-transfection of TP cDNA
was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis and its activity was determined
by spectrophotometric assay. Our results showed the anticancer
effectiveness of human HT29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells co-cultured
with TP-expressing MSCs was enhanced with the addition of various dosages
of doxifluridine.
