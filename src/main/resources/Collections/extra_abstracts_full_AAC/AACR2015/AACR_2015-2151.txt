Title: Development of reference reagents to accelerate research on the
RAS pathway


The Ras Reference Reagents program within the NCI national Ras mission is
designed to produce and distribute qualified DNA vectors, cell lines, and
viruses to supply to the external community to facilitate research into
Ras biology and development of Ras cancer therapeutics. Initial sets of
reagents include sequence-verified libraries of Ras mutants and Ras
pathway genes in Gateway combinatorial cloning vectors in multiple
formats. An associated library of combinatorial components is also
available to permit simple generation of expression vectors with various
promoters, fusion tags, and plasmid backbones. Additional reagents under
construction validated plasmid and lentiviral reagents for shRNA and
CRISPR delivery, qualified cell lines, and systems for the generation of
highly purified and characterized Ras and Ras-related proteins. All of
these resources are readily available to the academic community through
simple mechanisms, and can be licensed to industry as well. The Ras
Reference Reagents program is also interested in identifying the needs of
the community for additional Ras-related resources, and is developing
methods for vetting requests from the outside to provide additional
reagents.
