Title: Complement C5 promotes male bias of pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumor metastasis


Among patients with neuroendocrine tumors, males are more likely than
females to develop liver metastatic disease. We show that this male bias
toward liver metastasis is also observed in a mouse model for pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumorigenesis (PanNETs). Interestingly, primary tumors
from mice with metastatic disease display hepatomimicry, expressing genes
normally expressed in liver. Both male and female primary tumors from
mice with metastatic disease show hepatomimicry, although one of the
liver genes, complement C5, is only induced in males. In mice knocked out
for the complement C5 gene, the frequency of liver metastasis dropped
significantly; moreover, males and females lacking a gene for complement
C5 developed liver metastasis at the same frequency. Liver metastasis was
also prevented by PMX53, a small molecule antagonist of C5aR1/CD88, which
is the receptor for complement C5a. Thus complement C5 is epistatic to
metastasis and promotes gender bias of liver metastatic disease.
