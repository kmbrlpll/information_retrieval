Title: Pharmacological sequestration of Skp1 causes degradation of
oncogenic E3 ligases and mitotic blockade


Skp1 is an essential adaptor protein of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein
complex and is able to stabilize the conformation of some ubiquitin E3
ligases. However, the role Skp1 plays during tumorigenesis remains
unclear and Skp1-targeting agent is lacking. Here we showed that Skp1 was
overexpressed in 33/56 (58.9%) non-small cell lung cancers, and elevated
Skp1 was associated with poor prognosis. By structure-based
high-throughput virtual screening, we found some Skp1-targeting compounds
including 6-O-angeloylplenolin (6-OAP). 6-OAP could bind to Skp1 at sites
critical to Skp1-Skp2 interaction, leading to dissociation and
proteolysis of oncogenic E3 ligases NIPA, Skp2, and -TRCP. Consequently,
substrates of these E3 ligases Cyclin B1, P27 and E-Cadherin accumulated
within the cells and caused prometaphase arrest. 6-OAP exhibited potent
anti-lung cancer activity in two murine models and showed low adverse
effect. These results indicate that Skp1 is critical to lung cancer
pathogenesis, and targeting Skp1 can inactivate crucial oncogenic E3
ligases and exhibits significant therapeutic potentials.
