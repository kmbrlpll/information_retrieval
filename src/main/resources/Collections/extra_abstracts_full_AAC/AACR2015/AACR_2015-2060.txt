Title: DUSP6 phosphatase as a tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung
cancer


DUSP6/MKP3 a Map Kinase phosphatase involved in dephosphorylation and
inactivation of ERK1/2 is a key gene whose expression in NSCLC is
regulated by the DUSP1 Map Kinase phosphatase. Here we show that DUSP6
plays a major role in the regulation of cell migration, motility and
tumor growth. We have found upregulation in the expression of several
genes involved in Epidermal to mesenchimal transition in NSCLC-DUSP6
depleted cells. Furthermore ERK5 expression and phosphorylation, but not
ERK1/2 is greatly enhanced in these cells. Finally the data obtained in
RNAseq studies carried out in DUSP6 depleted cells identified several
genes such as VAV3, RUNXR2, LEF1, FGFR2 whose expression is upregulated
in these cells and affecting cellular functions such as integrin mediated
cell adhesion and focal adhesion supporting the changes in cell adhesion
and motility observed in DUSP6 depleted cells. TGF pathway is activated
in these cells as we have observed phosphorylation of SMAD3 and
consequently inhibition of TGF reduces the expression of EMT genes.
Finally in silico studies from Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer
Genome Atlas databases indicates that those NSCLC patients with low
expression of DUSP6 are those with the worst prognosis.
