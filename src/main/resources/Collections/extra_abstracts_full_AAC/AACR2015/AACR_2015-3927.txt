Title: Structural and mechanistic insights into the roles of RIAM in
integrin signaling


Changes in integrin signaling promotes tumor cell proliferation,
metastasis and survival. The Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM)
mediates integrin activation by responding to Rap1 activation and
recruiting talin, the integrin activator, to the plasma membrane (PM).
The structural details of how RIAM is recognized by Rap1 and in turn
recruits talin are lacking. We have elucidated the specificities for RIAM
interacting with Rap1 and talin via X-ray crystallography and functional
analyses. Crystal structure of Rap1 in complex with the central
structural module of RIAM reveals essential specificity determinants,
especially a Lys31 residue that is oppositely charged in other Ras
GTPases. Furthermore, our study on the RIAM:talin interaction suggests
that the talin-binding site 1 (TBS1) of RIAM is required for recruiting
cytoplasmic talin to the PM, primarily via an interaction with the R8
domain of talin. Interestingly, an unexpected kink in the helical TBS1
fragment is required for inducing integrin activation. These
characteristics are not seen in other related molecules including the
highly homologous Lpd, providing the molecular basis for the specific
signaling function of RIAM that mediates the integrin activation.
