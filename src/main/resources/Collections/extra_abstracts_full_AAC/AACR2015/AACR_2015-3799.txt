Title: Cordyceptin induces apoptosis through repressing hTERT expression
and inducing extranuclear export of hTERT


Cordycepin is an adenosine analog originally extracted from Cordyceps
militaris that possesses many pharmacological effects including immune
activation and antioxidant and antitumor effects. However, the underlying
relationship between apoptosis and telomerase activity in response to
cordycepin exposure has not been investigated. In this study, we found
that cordycepin-induced apoptosis of human leukemia cells (H937 and THP-1
cells) was associated with inactivation of telomerase and downregulation
of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) as well as the
transcription factors c-Myc and Sp1, which are required for basal
transcription from the hTERT gene promoter. Cordycepin also attenuated
the activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, thereby
reducing phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of hTERT. We further
showed that the PI3K inhibitor LY29004 significantly decreased telomerase
activity in cordycepin-treated cells and increased cordycepin-induced
cell death. These findings demonstrate that cordycepin is cytotoxic to
human leukemia cells and suppresses telomerase activity through
transcriptional and post-translational suppression of hTERT by
inactivating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
