Title: Ethanol potentiates tobacco smoke carcinogens-induced MAPK
activation


Alcohol consumption along with smoking is a well-known health hazard to
human. How alcohol consumption potentiates the smoking mediated hazard is
not clear. Previously we reported that DNA damage caused by tobacco smoke
carcinogen (+/-) anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7, 8-diol-9,10-epoxide [BPDE] is
responded by cells through induction of cell growth inhibition in
different cell lines. Here we observed that ethanol (EtOH) treatment at
physiologically relevant concentration (60mM) increases the DNA synthesis
in DNA damaging carcinogen (BPDE) treated cells. BPDE treatment of cells
elicits G1-S cell cycle arrest, but EtOH does not have any significant
modulating effect of G1-S arrest, indicating increased DNA synthesis by
EtOH is due to modulation of some other signaling event(s). We observed
that EtOH co-treatment/ pretreatment potentiates BPDE induced
phosphorylation and activation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2). Interestingly, treatment of cells with MEK1 inhibitor (PD09059)
significantly reduced EtOH's ability to increase DNA synthesis in BPDE
treated cells. All together, these findings suggest that the ability of
EtOH to potentiate BPDE-induced ERK activation may potentiates
PAH-induced tumorigenesis. [Supported by NIH grant # R03 ES021779].
