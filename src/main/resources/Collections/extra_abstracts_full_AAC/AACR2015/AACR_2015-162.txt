Title: Overexpression of long noncoding RNA FTX was associated with
colorectal cancer progression


Increasing evidence suggests Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have crucial
roles in cancer biology. Using public microarray database, we evaluated
the association between the expression status of lncRNAs and colorectal
cancer (CRC) prognosis. Among the candidate lncRNAs showed significant
higher expression in CRC patients with poor prognosis, we focused on FTX
on chromosome X. We validated FTX expression status in 128 primary tumor
samples and corresponding normal tissues from CRC patients through
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Primary tumor tissues
exhibited higher FTX expression compared to corresponding normal tissues
(p = 0.0008). In terms of overall survival, patients in the FTX high
expression group (n = 74) had a significantly poorer prognosis than those
in the FTX low expression group (n = 74). Multivaliate analysis of
overall survival revealed that the level of FTX expression was a
prognostic predictor. FTX knockdown inhibited tumor cell proliferation in
CRC cell line, HT29. Our results indicate that overexpression of FTX may
affect CRC progression.
