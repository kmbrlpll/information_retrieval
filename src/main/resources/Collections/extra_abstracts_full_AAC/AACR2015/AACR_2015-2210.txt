Title: DNA methylation to identify non-coding gene regulatory regions in
tumor samples


Altered control of transcriptional regulation via mutations to
transcription factors and chromatin modifiers is a hallmark of cancer.
Many popular methods for studying transcriptional regulation, such as
ChIP-seq, DNase-I hypersensitivity, and Chromatin Conformation Capture,
can be challenging to apply to clinical samples. DNA methylation has long
been the chromatin biomarker of choice in disease studies because of its
stability under clinical collection conditions. We have used DNA
methylation profiles of thousands of tumors within the TCGA to
reconstruct cancer-specific transcription factor regulatory networks,
including non-coding transcription factor binding sites in enhancer
regions. We use methyl-expression QTL (M->E QTL) analysis to associate
changes at individual binding sites with their gene targets, often
hundreds of thousands of base pairs away. This new approach allows for
the first time the identification of in vivo enhancer changes in
thousands of individuals, and provides a technology platform to identify
key regulatory events in cancer progression.Note: This abstract was not
