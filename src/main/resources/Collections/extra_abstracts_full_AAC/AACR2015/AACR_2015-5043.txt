Title: ER decreases the invasiveness of triple-negative breast cancer
cells by regulating mutant p53 gain-of-function


Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) display distinct metastatic
potential and a poor prognosis despite a relative chemosensitivity. Most
(80%) of these highly aggressive tumors express mutant p53 proteins that
are known to elicit oncogenic activities that contribute to metastasis
and chemoresistance. Despite the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), TNBCs
express wild-type ER (ER1). We previously showed that ER1 impedes
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TNBC cells by repressing
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Our recent findings
indicate that ER1 regulates EGFR expression and decreases the
invasiveness of TNBC cells by interacting with mutant p53 and inhibiting
its function. Suppression of a mutant p53 transcriptional program and
induction of p63 activity are essential for the anti-migratory activity
of ER1 in TNBC cells. These results describe an ER1/mutant p53
interaction that disturbs oncogenic signals to inhibit aggressiveness in
TNBC.
