Title: Cadherin 17 plays an important role in breast cancer metastasis to
bone marrow


To understand the mechanism underlying bone marrow metastasis in breast
cancer, we have established a highly bone marrow metastatic mouse breast
cancer cell line, 4T1E/M3. While metastatic potential of 4T1E/M3 to bone
was quite high (about 80%) when injected intravenously to mice, it was
rather low (about 20%) when injected subcutaneously. Then using 4T1E/M3
cells, we carried out the in vitro and in vivo selection and established
higher bone marrow metastatic cells, FP10SC2, which have a very high
potential of metastases to lungs (100%) and spines (85%) when
subcutaneously injected to mice. DNA microarray analysis revealed that
the gene expression of cadherin17 was upregulated in FP10SC2 compared to
the parental 4T1E/M3. When the expression of cadherin17 was suppressed by
RNAi, the anchorage independent growth and migration activity was
dramatically decreased. Moreover, metastatic activity of
cadherin17(-)/FP10SC2 to spines was significantly reduced compared to
control/FP10SC2. When cadherin 17 was overexpressed in 4T1E/M3 parental
cells, the colony formation and migration activity was clearly augmented.
Taken together, it was suggested that cadherin 17 plays an important role
on breast cancer metastasis to bone marrow.
