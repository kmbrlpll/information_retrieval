Title: Genetic and functional diversity of propagating cells in
glioblastoma


Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal malignancy whose clinical intransigence
has been linked to extensive intraclonal genetic and phenotypic diversity
and the common emergence of therapeutic resistance. This interpretation
embodies the implicit assumption that cancer stem cells or
tumor-propagating cells are themselves genetically and functionally
diverse. To test this, we screened primary GBM tumors by SNP array to
identify copy number alterations (a minimum of three) that could be
visualized in single cells by multicolor fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Interrogation of neurosphere-derived cells (from four
patients) and cells derived from secondary transplants of these same
cells in NOD-SCID mice allowed us to infer the clonal and phylogenetic
architectures. Whole-exome sequencing and single-cell genetic analysis in
one case revealed a more complex clonal structure.This proof-of-principle
experiment revealed that subclones in each GBM had variable regenerative
or stem cell activity, and highlighted genetic alterations associated
with more competitive propagating activity in vivo.
