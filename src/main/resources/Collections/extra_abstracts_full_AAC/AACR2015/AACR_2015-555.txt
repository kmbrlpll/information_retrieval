Title: A workflow for enrichment and whole genome amplification (WGA) of
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for next generation sequencing


Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Circulating tumor cells
(CTCs) are thought to be responsible for the seeding of metastases. These
tumor cells are heterogeneous with variation occurring at the single-cell
level. Using a flexible micro spring array (FMSA) device for label-free
mechanical enrichment of CTCs from whole blood samples, we established a
workflow from isolation followed by whole genome amplification (WGA) and
finally sequencing of circulating tumor cells. Briefly, circulating tumor
cells were collected from the FMSA using the Zeiss Laser Capture
Microdissection System. Isolated cells underwent whole genome
amplification using a commercial WGA kit. The quality of the amplified
genomic DNA was analyzed using the TaqMan Real-Time PCR Assays. Specific
loci were then amplified with the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2
and sequenced using the Ion PGM System. These studies were performed to
understand the genomic heterogeneity observed in circulating tumor cells.
