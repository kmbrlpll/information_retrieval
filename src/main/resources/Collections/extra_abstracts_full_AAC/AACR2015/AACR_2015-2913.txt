Title: Transcriptional reprogramming of pancreatic stroma induces
metabolic changes in pancreatic tumor cells


Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal of all solid tumors
largely due to an aggressive stroma that constitutes the bulk of the
tumor. The notion of a reprogrammed stroma suggests the re-establishment
of a physiologically normal tumor microenvironment with quiescent
stellate cells and fibroblasts. The induction of a quiescent phenotype
hinders the aberrant tumor-stroma crosstalk and enables the increased
intratumoral delivery of chemo drugs. A combinatorial transcriptional
therapy has proven successful at normalizing the tumor microenvironment
by reverting the activated state of stromal cells back to quiescence,
both at the phenotypic and genetic levels. Indeed, we have observed a
reduction in the activation markers of primary human stellate cells and
fibroblasts, accompanied by an increase in the quiescence markers.
Observations from methylation/hydroxymethylation profiling and metabolic
rewiring through isotopomer flux analysis revealed potential targets for
therapeutic intervention. In addition, the differential metabolic
rewiring induced by a quiescent stroma in cancer cells suggests a tumor
suppressive environment aimed at weakening an otherwise aggressive cancer.
