Title: Prolonged silencing of diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 induces a
dedifferentiated phenotype in human liver cells


Diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1), a key enzyme in triglyceride
(TG) biogenesis, is highly associated with metabolic abnormalities, such
as obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the effects of DGAT1 sliencing
in the human liver have not been elucidated. To investigate the effects
of DGAT1 silencing in human liver cells, we compared the cellular
behaviors of DGAT1-deficient Huh-7.5 cell lines with those of control
Huh-7.5 cells. DGAT1-deficient cells acquired dedifferentiated and stem
cell-like characteristics, such as formation of aggregates in the
presence of high levels of growth factors, high proliferation rates, and
loss of albumin secretion. In relation to aggregate formation, the
expression level of various adhesion molecules was significantly altered
in DGAT1-deficient cells. Microarray data analysis and immunostaining of
patient tissue samples clearly showed decreased expression levels of
DGAT1 and integrin 1 in patients who have nodular cirrhosis without fatty
degeneration.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.
