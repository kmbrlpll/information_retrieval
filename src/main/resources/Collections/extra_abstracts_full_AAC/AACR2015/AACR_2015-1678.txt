Title: Bioavailability and anti-tumor activity of capsaicin in human
small cell lung cancer


The nutritional compound capsaicin has been shown to display
anti-neoplastic activity in breast, prostate and colon tumors xenografted
in nude mice. Based on these data from other research laboratories, we
wanted to determine the bioavailability of capsaicin in nude mice in
vivo. We found that capsaicin was rapidly metabolized primarily in the
liver. The bioavailability of intact capsaicin was highest in the lung.
Therefore, we hypothesized that capsaicin should suppress the growth of
lung tumors. We found that capsaicin induced robust apoptosis in human
SCLC cell lines. Capsaicin decreased the growth rates of human SCLC
tumors in two in vivo models, namely the CAM model and the nude mouse
model. HPLC studies showed intact capsaicin in the tumors excised from
nude mice. The heat-sensation activity of capsaicin is mediated by the
transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) family of proteins.
Capsaicin functions as an agonist of the TRPV1 receptor. The apoptotic
activity of capsaicin was found to be mediated by TRPV6 and not TRPV1.
Preliminary data shows that capsaicin increases the expression of the
TRPV6 receptor, causing apoptosis in human SCLCs.
