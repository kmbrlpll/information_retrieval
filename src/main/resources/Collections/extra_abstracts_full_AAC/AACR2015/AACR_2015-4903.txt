Title: Microarray gene expression analysis of human prostate cancer PC-3
cells targeted by Salmonella typhimurium A1-R


The transcriptional profile of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells infected
with tumor-targeting Salmonella typhimurium A1-R (A1-R) was analyzed with
by microarray. PC-3 is highly sensitive to A1-R. Numerous genes involved
in diverse cellular processes, including apoptosis, necrotic cell death,
neutrophil chemotaxis and innate immunity were significantly up-regulated
by A1-R bacterial infection. Such up-regulated genes include TNF-a, Fos
and JUN which are involved in cell death and IL-1A and CXCL which are
involved in neutrophil chemotaxes. Knowledge of the up-regulated gene
profile will be exploited for enhancing prostate tumor targeting by
A1-R.Keywords: Salmonella typhimurium A1-R, human prostate cancer,
