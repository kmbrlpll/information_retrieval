Title: Role of mitochondria elongation in p53-induced cellular senescence


Various stresses such as oncogene activation, oxidative stress, and
activation of tumor suppressors induce cellular senescence in both normal
and cancer cells. This phenomenon, termed premature senescence or
accelerated senescence, acts as an important barrier against
tumorigenesis and is also considered to be a potential mechanism for
controlling human cancers. Although mitochondria has been implicated in
cancer, but the exact role of mitochondria in premature senescence has
not been fully determined. Here, we studied how morphological and
functional change in mitochondria involves in the onset of p53-induced
premature senescence. Upon p53 expression in p53-defective cancer cells,
extensive elongation of mitochondria network and functional defects in
mitochondria were detected. Antioxidant NAC treatment indicates that
mitochondria elongation induces increase the level of ROS, which is an
important mediator for cellular senescence. Our results suggest that
morphology change and subsequent dysfunction of mitochondria play a
critical role in p53-induced premature senescence.
