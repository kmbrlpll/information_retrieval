Title: Targeting the MLL complex in castration resistant prostate cancer


Resistance to androgen deprivation therapies and increased androgen
receptor (AR) activity are major drivers of castration resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC). Substantial prior work has focused on targeting AR
directly; however, the identification and therapeutic targeting of
co-activators of AR signaling remains an underexplored area of potential
clinical significance. Here we demonstrate that the MLL (mixed-lineage
leukemia) complex, a well-known contributor in MLL-fusion-positive
leukemia, acts as a co-activator of AR signaling. AR directly interacts
with the MLL complex via its critical subunit, menin. Small molecule
inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction blocks AR signaling and inhibits
the growth of castration resistant tumors in vivo. Furthermore, we find
that menin is up-regulated in castration resistant prostate cancer and
high expression correlates with poor overall survival. Taken together,
our study identifies the MLL complex as a critical co-activator of AR
that can be targeted in advanced prostate cancer.
