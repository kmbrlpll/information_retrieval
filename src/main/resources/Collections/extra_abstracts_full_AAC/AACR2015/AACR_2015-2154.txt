Title: ERK/MAPK pathway inhibits tumorigenesis and cellular reprogramming
of pancreatic cancer cells


Reprogrammation of cancer cells into stem-like state is one the most
important mechanisms implicated in tumor initiation, metastasis and
resistance to chemotherapies. Acquisition of stem-like cell property is
directly correlated with the level of activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway.
Our study focuses on the implication of the downregulation of this
pathway during the transition of pancreatic benign neoplasms to
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This transformation is directly
correlated with the acquisition of stem-like cells properties.
Conversely, hyperactivation of the ERK pathway using phosphatase
inhibitors abrogates the stem-like cell phenotype.We analyzed the
variation of genes expression by microarrays analysis between cells
obtained from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias and pancreatic
cancer. These analyses implicate the expression of DUSPs and genes
related to stem cell biology in tumor progression during pancreatic
cancer.
