Title: Development of Hsp90 paralog specific inhibitors with
mitochondrial drug delivery system


The mitochondrial pool of Hsp90 and its mitochondrial paralog, TRAP1,
suppresses cell death and reprograms energy metabolism in cancer cells;
therefore, Hsp90 and TRAP1 have been suggested as target proteins for
anticancer drug development. Here, we report that the actual target
protein in cancer cell mitochondria is TRAP1, not Hsp90, and current
Hsp90 inhibitors cannot effectively inactivate TRAP1 due to insufficient
accumulation in the mitochondria. To develop mitochondrial TRAP1
inhibitors, we determined the crystal structures of human TRAP1 complexed
with Hsp90 inhibitors. The isopropyl amine of the Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71
was replaced with the mitochondria-targeting moiety triphenylphosphonium
to produce SMTIN-P01. SMTIN-P01 showed a different mode of action from
the non-targeted PU-H71, as well as much improved cytotoxicity to cancer
cells. In addition, we determined the structure of a
TRAP1-adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) complex. Based on comparative
analysis of TRAP1 structures, we propose a molecular mechanism of ATP
hydrolysis that is crucial for chaperone function.
