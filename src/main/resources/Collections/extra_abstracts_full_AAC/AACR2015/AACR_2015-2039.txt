Title: Trim21: A novel regulator of Par-4 and oncogenic signaling


Prostate apoptosis response protein 4 (Par-4) is a tumor suppressor that
induces apoptosis selectively in cancer cells. Although Par-4 levels have
been shown to be regulated by ubiqutin-mediated proteolysis, it is not
known whether Par-4 function is regulated by ubiquination. To identify
novel protein interaction partners of Par-4, we used
co-immunoprecipitation of Par-4, followed by in-solution trypsin
digestion and mass spectrometry. We demonstrate that Trim21, an E3 ligase
that acts as a negative regulator of inflammatory signaling partially
through ubiquitination of various downstream transcription factors, is a
novel Par-4 interacting protein, and may regulate the activity of Par-4.
Furthermore, similar to Par-4, we found that Trim21 inhibits Akt
activation. Our studies reveal that Trim21 is a novel E3 ligase of Par-4,
and extends its role from regulation of immune signaling to regulation of
apoptosis and oncogenic signaling in colon cancer cells.
