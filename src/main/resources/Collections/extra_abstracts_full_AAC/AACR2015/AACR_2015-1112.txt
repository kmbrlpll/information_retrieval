Title: Loss-of-function genetic screening with shRNA and CRISPR libraries


Genome-wide loss-of-function screens provide a direct approach to
identify the genes regulating biological responses and find new
therapeutic targets. While RNAi screens have proven an effective tool for
these screens, CRISPR/CAS9 provides an alternative approach to implement
these screens. To complement our established shRNA screening platform, we
have developed pooled format genome-wide modular sgRNA libraries for
cost-effective functional CRISPR knockout screens. Pooled sgRNA and shRNA
libraries were then run to identify lethal interactions in isogenic
PDX-derived cell line pairs.
