Title: Interleukin-10 and programmed death-1 cooperate to regulate tumor
antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in melanoma patients


With the recent success of immune checkpoint blockade in the clinic, it
is expected that strategies aimed at counteracting the negative
immunoregulatory networks in the tumor microenvironment will develop into
potent therapy for melanoma. Here, we report that programmed death-1high
(PD-1high) tumor antigen (TA)-specific CD8+ T cells present at periphery
and at tumor sites in patients with advanced melanoma upregulate IL-10
receptor (IL-10R) expression. IL-10 is produced by multiple PBMC subsets
in melanoma patients and acts directly on IL-10R+ TA-specific CD8+ T
cells to impede proliferation and increase apoptosis. PD-1 blockade
augments IL-10R expression by TA-specific CD8+ T cells, suggesting that
PD-1 blockade renders PD-1+ TA-specific CD8+ T cells more sensitive to
the immunosuppressive effects of endogenous IL-10. As a result, we show
that IL-10 blockade adds to PD-1 blockade to increase the expansion and
functions of TA-specific CD8+ T cells. Collectively, our findings support
dual IL-10 and PD-1 blockade to counteract melanoma-induced T cell
dysfunction and enhance TA-specific CD8+ T cell responses in patients
with advanced melanoma.
