Title: Targeting the translational enhancer complex MCT-1:DenR to disrupt
NHL survival


Despite the vast number of therapeutic advances that have been made,
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) remains a leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in the United States. In order to increase the NHL cure rate, new
targeted options are needed. One such option that has been the focus of
much recent interest is the post-transcriptional regulation in
anti-apoptotic phenotypes of NHL, particularly the translational enhancer
complex of MCT-1 and DENR. Involved in translation initiation and
ribosomal recycling for transcripts regulated by 5-uORFs, the MCT-1:DENR
complex has been shown to increase cell proliferation and the translation
of survival-related transcripts through the combination of two critical
RNA-binding domains. The goal of this project has been to biophysically
characterize the formation and activity of this complex and to develop a
method for evaluating the effects of disrupting its formation in vivo
through the combination of NMR, X-ray crystallography, cell-free and
cell-based assays. Ultimately, the information gained from this study
will be used to evaluate a library of perturbagens that interfere with
dimer formation and the development of MCT-1 driven anti-apoptotic
phenotypes.
