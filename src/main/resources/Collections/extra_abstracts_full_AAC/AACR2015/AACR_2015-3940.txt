Title: Inactivation of the PARD3 gene is a recurrent event in lung
squamous cell carcinomas and affects STAT3 activity and tumor invasiveness


Correct apicobasal polarization and intercellular adhesions are essential
for the appropriate development of normal epithelia. Here, we
investigated the contribution of the partitioning defective 3 gene,
PARD3, to the carcinogenesis of lung squamous cell carcinomas (LSCCs).
Tumor-specific PARD3 alterations were found in eight per cent of the
tumors, placing PARD3 among the most common tumor suppressor genes in
LSCC. Some PAR3 mutant proteins prevented the formation of contacts
between neighboring cells, i.e. had reduced ability to form tight
junctions and actin-based protrusions. This affected subsequent
downstream signaling, i.e. binding to aPKC and activation of RAC1.
Further, we discovered that PAR3 wild type triggered the expression of
cell adhesion and polarity-related transcripts and the activation of
STAT3, by cell confluence. Finally, restitution of PAR3 in vivo
significantly reduced the formation of metastasis. In conclusion, PARD3
is recurrently inactivated in LSCC and its deficiency contributes to the
tumor aggressiveness.
