Title: A natural alkaloid, berberine, as a novel transcriptional
repressor of RET proto-oncogene in medullary thyroid carcinoma


The development of several medullary thyroid carcinomas is strongly
associated with the gain-of-function mutation of the RET proto-oncogene,
which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, so that the RET protein has
been regarded as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of
progressive and advanced MTC. In our study we have explored a new
strategy to repress the transcription of the RET proto-oncogene in MTC
using small molecules. Interestingly, we found that a natural product
berberine inhibits the RET gene transcription by specifically targeting
the promoter region of this gene, thereby reducing the RET protein
expression in MTC TT cells. The down-regulation of RET with berberine
also results in the suppression of cell proliferation through cell cycle
arrest and activation of apoptosis in TT cells. Overall, our results
strongly suggest that berberine stabilizes G-quadruplexes formed from the
G-rich sequence present on the promoter region of this gene and the
stabilization of this structure play a critical role in mediating the
repressive effect of berberine on RET transcription.
