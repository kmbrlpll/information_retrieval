Title: Genomics-based resistome analysis revealed endogenous adenosine
kinase levels as a chief determinant of specificity for a novel
nucleoside analog lymphoma inhibitor


We used KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells as a model to
search for novel drugs through a combination of screening and genomic
approaches. We discovered 6-ethylthioinosine (6-ETI), a nucleoside
analog, as a highly effective and selective inhibitor of PEL. This
compound induces necrosis accompanied by S-phase arrest without affecting
known oncogenic viral proteins. To understand the selectivity towards
PEL, we performed unbiased genomic analysis of 6-ETI-resistant subclones
using RNASeq, which revealed that 6-ETI is activated through
phosphorylation by cellular adenosine kinase (ADK). PEL cell lines have
higher basal levels of ADK than resistant lymphoma cell lines, and
resistant lymphoma cell lines could be sensitized by cell
crowding-induced ADK upregulation. Finally, 6-ETI was shown to be highly
efficacious against incipient and established tumors in a mouse model of
PEL, with no apparent toxicity. Thus, we have successfully used
RNASeq-based resistome analysis to identify the mechanism of specificity
for a new and preclinically effective nucleoside analog.
