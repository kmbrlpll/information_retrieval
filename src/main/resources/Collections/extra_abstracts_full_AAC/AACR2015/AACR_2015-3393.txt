Title: Using protein microarray technology to screen anti-PD-1 monoclonal
antibodies for specificity and applications in anatomic pathology


Programmed death-1 (PD-1) expresses in many tumors in response to
inflammation. It is up-regulated in activated T lymphocytes and inhibits
T-cell function upon binding to its ligands PD-L1 and PDL2 and serves as
a key checkpoint of the immune system. Pembrolizumab is the first
anti-PD-1 therapy approved in the United States and received FDA's
Breakthrough Therapy designation for advanced melanoma. Thus, to evaluate
PD1 protein levels in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples, a
high quality monoclonal antibody validated for immunohistochemistry (IHC)
is needed.To develop the best monoclonal antibody for PD-1 IHC analysis,
41 monoclonal antibodies were generated. 8 of them work for IHC
application on FFPE tissue sections. To identify clones that are
mono-specific on target, only two clones passed our high density protein
microarray chip tests. Other immunoassays and species cross-reactivity
tests were also explored.In summary, two newly generated monoclonal
antibodies demonstrated ultra-specificity against PD-1 protein and
superior performance for IHC analyses. These two clones could be utilized
as companion diagnostic reagents to stratify cancer patients before
pembrolizumab prescription.
