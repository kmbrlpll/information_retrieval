Title: Esophageal cancer exhibits a resistance to the chemical inhibition
of IGF-1R with a maintained Ras-MAPK activity


The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) and its
associated signaling system play a significant role in carcinogenesis and
progression of gastrointestinal malignancies, and thus have provoked
great interest as a promising target for cancer treatment. The aim of our
study was to assess the effects of a novel IGF-1R inhibitor, NVP-AEW541,
on the cell proliferation and signal transduction of esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma. Five human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell lines
(TE-1, TE-4, TE-8, TE-10 and T.Tn) were treated with this inhibitor and
the IC50 of NVP-AEW541 for each cell line was more than 1M, exhibiting
that these cells were less sensitive to this compound. The activation of
IGF-1R and AKT were dose dependently blocked by NVP-AEW541. However, the
activities of the key molecules in Ras-MAPK pathway was not significantly
inhibited by NVP-AEW541 without any major mutation of Ras. These results
indicate that esophageal squamous cell carcinoma may be resistant to
targeting IGF-IR due to its maintenance of Ras-MAPK signaling. Thus, to
explore the potential mechanism of resistance will contribute to the
therapeutic application for NVP-AEW541.
