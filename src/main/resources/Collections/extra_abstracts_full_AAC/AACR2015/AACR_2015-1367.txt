Title: Anti-angiogenesis promotes venous thromboembolism through inducing
PAI-1 in a mouse xenograft model of human lung carcinoma


Thromboembolism is a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients
with cancer. Increased incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was
associated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment
in cancer. However, the mechanism of VTE initiation remains elusive. In
this study, we addressed the effect of bevacizumab, a humanized
monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A on either an inferior vena cava
stenosis or a saphenous vein model using a xenograft mouse model. We
found that treatment of bevacizumab accelerated thrombosis in a saphenous
vein model with an increased thrombus weight in an inferior vena cava
stenosis model. Administration of bevacizumab inhibited the growth of
lung tumor by suppressing angiogenesis. Both intrathrombotic PAI-1
expression and plasma PAI-1 level was significantly increased by the
treatment of bevacizumab. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of PAI-1
with PAI-039 blocked the bevacizumab-induced venous thrombosis, but
showed no change in tumor growth. Collectively, these findings indicate
that PAI-1 plays a role in VET with anti-angiogenesis therapy, and have
efficacy as a therapeutic strategy to prevent VET.
