Title: RNA editing reveals new regulatory functions in tumorigenesis


RNA Editing is a widespread post-transcriptional event that could
increase the diversity of transcriptome. In humans, the most common type
of RNA editing is adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing which is
catalyzed by a family of enzymes called adenosine deaminase acting on RNA
(ADARs). Over 90% A-to-I RNA editing sites locate in Alu elements, the
most abundant transposable elements in human genome. We picked up 83 CEU
individuals and 89 YRI individuals for RNA editing analysis. 94,315
credible sites are obtained after series of strict computational
procedures. Those genes whose transcripts harbor numerous RNA sites are
found to be enriched in several cancer-related pathways such as small
cell lung cancer pathway, p53 signaling pathway and apoptosis pathway.
Our work provides new insight into the regulation mechanism of RNA
editing acting on tumorigenesis.
