Title: Prostaglandin E2 promotes colorectal cancer stem-like cell
expansion and metastasis


Emerging evidence suggests that chronic inflammation and inflammatory
mediators contribute to cancer stem-like cell (CSLC) formation,
maintenance, and expansion. However, the mechanisms underlying their
contribution to CSLC regulation are poorly understood. Here we
demonstrate that an inflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
induces colorectal CSLC expansion in vivo and in vitro. PGE2 also
accelerates liver metastatic tumor incidence and numbers in an orthotopic
model. Furthermore, we show that NF-B is required for PGE2 induction of
CSLCs and colorectal tumor metastatic spread. PI3K and MAPK pathways
mediate PGE2 activation of NF-B in induction of CSLCs. These results
demonstrate that PGE2 induces colorectal CSLC expansion by activating
NF-B via PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways. Our findings not only uncover a
previously unrecognized role of PGE2 in induction of CSLCs and
metastasis, but also may delineate a novel therapeutic approach for CRC
patients by targeting CSLCs via inhibition of the PGE2 signaling pathway.
