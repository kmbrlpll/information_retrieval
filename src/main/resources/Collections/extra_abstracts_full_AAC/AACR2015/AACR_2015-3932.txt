Title: Using Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis to identify CRC
driver genes


In order to better understand the initiation and development of
colorectal cancer (CRC), Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis
screens were performed in mice with mutations in genes that play
important roles in differen stages of CRC. Functional validation assays,
including invasion assay and xenograft assay, were carried out for the
candidate genes that were selected by their potentials in tumor
progression and/or human CRC. We identified six genes driving malignant
tumor progression, and a new human CRC tumor suppressor gene, ZNF292,
that may also function in other types of cancer. More detailed
investigations are being done for those identified genes, including
experiments using knockout mice. Our study provides a resource for the
development of new CRC therapies.
