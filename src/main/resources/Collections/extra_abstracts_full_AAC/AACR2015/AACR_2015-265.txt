Title: Robust anti-tumor effects of combined anti-CD4 depleting antibody
and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint antibody treatment in mice


Depletion of CD4+ cells in tumor-bearing mice has strong anti-tumor
effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects and the
therapeutic benefits of CD4+ cell depletion relative to other
immunotherapies have not been fully evaluated. Here, we investigated the
anti-tumor effects of an anti-CD4 depleting monoclonal antibody (mAb) as
a monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint mAbs. In B16F10,
Colon 26 or LLC subcutaneous tumor models, administration of the anti-CD4
mAb alone had strong anti-tumor effects that were superior to those
elicited by CD25+ Treg depletion or other immune checkpoint mAbs, and
which were completely reversed by CD8+ cell depletion. CD4+ cell
depletion led to the proliferation of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in the
draining lymph node and increased infiltration of PD-1+CD8+ T cells into
the tumor, with a shift towards type I immunity within the tumor.
Combination treatment with the anti-CD4 mAb and immune checkpoint mAbs,
particularly anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAbs, synergistically suppressed
tumor growth and greatly prolonged survival. To our knowledge, this work
represents the first report of robust synergy between anti-CD4 and
anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAb therapies.
