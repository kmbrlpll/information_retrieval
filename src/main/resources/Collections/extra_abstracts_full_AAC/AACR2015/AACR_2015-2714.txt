Title: Effects of endosulfan on COX-2 expression via NADPH oxidase and
the ROS, MAPK, and Akt pathways


Endosulfan is correlated with endocrine disruption, reproductive, and
immune dysfunctions. Recently, endosulfan was shown to have an effect on
inflammatory pathways, but its influence on cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2)
expression is unclear. This study investigated the effects of COX-2 and
molecular mechanisms by endosulfan in murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells.
Endosulfan significantly induced COX-2 protein and mRNA levels, as well
as COX-2 promoter-driven luciferase activity and the production of
prostaglandin E2, a major COX-2 metabolite. Transfection experiments with
several human COX-2 promoter constructs revealed that endosulfan
activated NF-KB, C/EBP, AP-1, and CREB. Moreover, Akt and
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) were significantly activated by
endosulfan. Moreover, endosulfan increased production of the ROS and the
ROS-producing NAPDH-oxidase (NOX) family oxidases, NOX2, and NOX3. These
results demonstrate that endosulfan induces COX-2 expression via NADPH
oxidase, ROS, and Akt/MAPK pathways. These findings provide further
insight into the signal transduction pathways involved in the
inflammatory effects of endosulfan.
