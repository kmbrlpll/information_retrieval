Title: Discovery of a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of HSP90 for
cancer therapy


HSP90 is a major heat shock protein involved in the proper folding of its
client proteins including many onco-proteins. HSP90 is elevated in tumor
cells with a more active configuration, making it a potential target for
cancer drug development. Utilizing structure-base design, we discovered a
small molecule compound that inhibits HSP90 activity with an IC50 at low-
nanomolar concentration. Cell proliferation was inhibited by this
compound at a IC50 of single-digit nanomolar concentration across many
different cancer cell lines. Mechanism of action studies demonstrated
that this compound could induce HER-2 degradation in the breast cancer
cell line BT-474 in vitro at concentrations between 100-300 nM. The
compound showed an ideal pharmacological kinetic feature of less exposure
and fast clearance in rat retina after intravenous administration, thus
reducing the possibility of ocular toxicity as demonstrated by some other
earlier HSP90 inhibitors. The compound also caused tumor growth
inhibition in the xenograft tumor models, correlating with its target
inhibition activity in these tumors. These data supports further
development of this compound as a cancer therapeutic agent.
