Title: RHOA inactivation enhances Wnt signaling and promotes colorectal
cancer


Activation of the small GTPase RHOA has strong oncogenic effects in many
tumor types, although its role in colorectal cancer remains unclear. We
show that RHOA inactivation contributes to colorectal cancer
progression/metastasis, largely through the activation of Wnt/-catenin
signaling. RhoA inactivation in the murine intestine accelerates the
tumorigenic process and in human colon cancer cells leads to the
redistribution of -catenin from the membrane to the nucleus and enhanced
Wnt/-catenin signaling, resulting in increased proliferation, invasion
and de-differentiation. In mice, RHOA inactivation contributes to colon
cancer metastasis and reduced RHOA levels were observed at metastatic
sites compared to primary human colon tumors. Therefore, we have
identified a new mechanism of activation of Wnt/-catenin signaling and
characterized the role of RHOA as a novel gene with tumor suppressor
activity in colorectal cancer. These results constitute a shift from the
current paradigm and demonstrate that RHO GTPases can suppress tumor
progression and metastasis.
