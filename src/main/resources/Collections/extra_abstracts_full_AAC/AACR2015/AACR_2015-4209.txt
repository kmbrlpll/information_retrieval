Title: Development of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models for small
cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a preclinical platform for drug development


Small cell lung cancer comprises 15-20% of all lung cancer cases, is very
invasive with a high mortality rate. Although SCLC patients respond to
chemotherapy, there is a high rate of recurrence with treated patients
and those in advanced stage of the disease often have a refractory
response to treatment. As such, the need for new treatment modalities is
critical. In this work, we describe the development and characterization
including histopathology, IHC and mutational analysis of 8 SCLC PDX
models established from a collection of >300 small cell lung cancer
specimens, many of which come from prior-treated and metastatic patients.
We have also evaluated functional response of these models with in vivo
pharmacology studies. Our data demonstrates the potential to use these
unique PDX models in drug development for treatment of SCLC.
