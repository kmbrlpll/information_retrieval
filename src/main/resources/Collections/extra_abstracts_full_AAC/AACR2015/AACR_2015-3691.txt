Title: A chemical therapeutic screen identifies new targets for wt/wt
melanoma


Once advanced, melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer.
Metastatic melanoma has a 5-year survival rate of about 15%. Treatment of
melanoma is based by driver mutation - BRAF-mutant, NRAS-mutant, and
melanomas wild-type for BRAF and NRAS, termed wt/wt melanomas. While
targeted therapies are available for BRAF or NRAS mutant melanomas, no
effective targeted therapeutic options are available for wt/wt melanomas.
Furthermore, chemotherapy rapidly fails for this third subtype
prioritizing the need for novel therapies. We seek to overcome this
problem by identifying compounds to target wt/wt melanoma. To this end,
we have performed a chemical screen of clinically relevant compounds
against 8 wt/wt melanoma cell lines. In our screen, we have identified
compounds that specifically target critical proteins, such as ALK, PLK1,
and PI3K. Exome sequencing of each wt/wt melanoma line is being performed
to uncover specific genetic signatures that would allow for specific
susceptibility to each hit from the screen. This work will allow us to
develop personalized therapies for the treatment of patients with wt/wt
melanoma.
