Title: Discovery and development of novel USP2 inhibitors for cancer
therapy


Ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation control the stability, localization
and activity of many cellular proteins. Deubiquitylation is performed by
a family of 80 enzymes (DUBs) and many of these DUBs have been implicated
in a wide range of diseases including cancer. In particular, USP2 removes
ubiquitin selectively from Cyclin D1, Cyclin A1, Aurora A, MDM2 and FAS
which are all implicated in oncogenic processes. Importantly, USP2 is
overexpressed in prostate and ovarian cancers and inhibition of USP2 has
been shown to sensitize prostate carcinoma cells to apoptosis. Therefore
USP2 is an attractive therapeutic target. Progenra's unique UbiProTM
discovery platform was utilized to screen 200K member diversity based
library of small molecules for identifying novel USP2 inhibitors. Hits
from the screen were subjected to orthogonal selectivity assays to
identify USP2 specific inhibitors. Here we report discovery and hit to
lead optimization of novel USP2 inhibitors showing cellular efficacy and
anti-cancer activities against relevant cancer cell models. The most
promising compounds are being further developed as novel anti-cancer
agents.
