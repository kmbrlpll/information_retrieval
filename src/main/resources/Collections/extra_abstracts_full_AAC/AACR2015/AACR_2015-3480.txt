Title: Combinatorial apoptotic activity of capsaicin and camptothecin in
human small cell lung cancer


Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 13% of all lung cancer
cases and is the most aggressive form of lung cancer. Cisplatin and
cisplatin-based combination therapies are the cornerstone of SCLC
treatment. Platinum refractoriness is defined as disease which has
persisted or progressed (grown) while receiving cisplatin chemotherapy.
Patients with platinum resistant or refractory disease have very limited
options, as the only standard chemotherapy with an FDA-approved drug,
topotecan, has an objective response rate of approximately 3% and little
or no survival benefit. Topotecan is a derivative of camptothecin. The
objective of our study was to examine whether capsaicin could sensitize
human SCLC cells to the apoptotic effects of camptothecin. We observed
that the combination of capsaicin and camptothecin displays significantly
higher apoptotic activity in human SCLC cell lines as compared to either
agent alone. Chou-Talalay analysis showed that the interactions between
capsaicin and camptothecin were synergistic. We also measured the effect
of capsaicin-camptothecin combination on several Bcl-2 family proteins,
namely Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, etc. The results of our studies
may be of importance in therapy of platinum-refractory SCLCs.
