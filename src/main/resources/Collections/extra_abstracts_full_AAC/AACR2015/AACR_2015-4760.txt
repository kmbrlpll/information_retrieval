Title: Stromal contribution to the colorectal cancer transcriptome


Recent studies have identified a stem/serrated/mesenchymal (SSM)
molecular subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC) that is associated with poor
prognosis. We noted that genes upregulated in this subtype are also
prominently expressed by stromal cells. This led us to hypothesize that
the SSM transcripts could derive from the tumor microenvironment, rather
than being intrinsic to cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we
analyzed microarray and RNAseq expression data from patient-derived
xenografts (PDXs) of CRC, where human cancer cells are supported by
murine stroma. Species-specific expression analysis revealed that mRNA
levels of SSM genes are mostly due to stromal expression. Considering
only genes exclusively expressed by stromal cells in PDXs, We then built
three expression signatures specifically reporting the abundance of
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), leucocytes or endothelial cells. In
human CRC samples, all stromal signatures were strongly associated with
the SSM subtype. A high CAF signature was associated with poor prognosis
in untreated CRC patients, while in rectal cancer high stromal signatures
jointly predicted radioresistance. These data show that the distinctive
transcriptional and clinical features of the SSM subtype can be ascribed
to its particularly abundant stroma.
