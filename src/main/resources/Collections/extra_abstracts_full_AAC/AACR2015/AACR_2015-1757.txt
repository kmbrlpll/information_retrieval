Title: The new molecular target therapy of Hsp90 inhibition in esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma


Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has numerous cellular functions, including
promotion of proper protein folding, and stabilizes a number of oncogenic
proteins, many of which are overexpressed in cancers. The objective of
this study is to evaluate an antitumor effect of HSP90 inhibitor, AUY922,
in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(ESCC) cell lines. ESCC cell lines
were treated with AUY922 to examine the effect on proliferation assay,
apoptosis assay, Western blotting, and chemotaxis assay. AUY922 inhibited
cell proliferation in ESCC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
Growth inhibitory effect of AUY922 for ESCC cells was higher than CDDP.
With flowcytometry and immunostaining, we showed that AUY922 induced
apoptosis in ESCC cells and inhibited chemotaxis of ESCC cells. These
antitumor effects of AUY922 were due to inhibition of cell proliferation
through suppression of phosphorylation of the client proteins. The HSP90
inhibitor is useful as an antitumor drug in ESCC by inhibiting
proliferation of ESCC cells through novel mechanism.
