Title: Targeting connexin 43 with -connexin carboxyl-terminal (ACT1)
peptide in breast cancer


Expression and functional studies have identified connexins (Cxs), a
family of gap junction proteins, as potential tumor suppressors. Studies
suggest that connexin 43 (Cx43) has a role in breast cancer cell
proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Although pan-gap junction
drugs are available, the lack of specificity of these agents increases
the opportunity for off target effects. Consequently, a therapeutic agent
that specifically modulates Cx43 would be beneficial and has not been
tested in breast cancer. In this study, we now test a Cx43 specific
agent, called -connexin carboxyl-terminal (ACT1), in breast cancer. Our
studies demonstrate that modulation of Cx43 activity in breast cancer can
be effectively achieved with the agent ACT1 to sustain Cx43-mediated gap
junctional activity resulting in impaired malignant progression.
Furthermore, using ER+ and HER2+ breast cancer cell models, we show that
ACT1 treatment enhances the activity of lapatinib and tamoxifen.
