Title: A versatile tool to study immune checkpoint therapeutics: Syngenic
tumor mouse models in vivo


Checkpoint inhibitor treatment is a common therapy of various cancer
types, however, clinical data indicate that patients only partially
respond to this regiment due to attenuated anti-tumor immune response.
Thus, it has been recognized as important to consider the immune response
already during preclinical drug development in animal experiments to
anticipate such clinical drawbacks. Although immune-humanized models
using human leukocytes in immuno-compromised mice may provide a starting
point, syngenic mice models appear to be the better method of choice,
reflecting the whole spectrum of a functional immune system. Here, we
report on the establishment of syngenic mouse models for breast, colon,
kidney and skin cancer both for subcutaneous and orthotopic implantation.
Analyzing untreated as well as checkpoint inhibitor treated mice, we will
present data on tumor growth kinetics as well on the distribution of
immune cells such as Treg cells, M1/M2 macrophages and M/PMN-MDSCs in
tumor and spleen tissue based on multi-color flow-cytometric analysis.
These data may help to select a suitable model for testing new drug
candidates and define a sensitive combination therapy to support the
anti-tumor immune defense in addition to checkpoint inhibitor treatment.
