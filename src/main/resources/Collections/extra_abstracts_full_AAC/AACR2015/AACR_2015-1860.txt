Title: DNA-PK-mediated transcriptional regulation drives tumor
progression and metastasis


Emerging evidence demonstrates that the DNA repair kinase DNA-PK exerts
divergent roles in transcriptional regulation of unsolved consequence.
Here, in vitro and in vivo interrogation demonstrate that DNA-PK
functions as a selective modulator of transcriptional networks that
induce cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Accordingly, suppression
of DNA-PK inhibits tumor metastases. Clinical assessment revealed that
DNA-PK is significantly elevated in advanced disease, and independently
predicts for metastases, recurrence, and reduced overall survival.
Further investigation demonstrated that DNA-PK in advanced tumors is
highly activated, independently of DNA damage indicators. Combined, these
findings put forth new paradigms for DNA-PK function, identify DNA-PK as
a potent driver of tumor progression and metastases, and nominate DNA-PK
as a therapeutic target for advanced malignancies.
