Title: Carbon monoxide targets Notch1 and MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling pathways
to block growth of lung carcinoma


We have recently shown that inhalation of low, non-toxic doses of carbon
monoxide (CO) is a potential therapeutic adjuvant treatment for lung
cancer and prostate cancer (Cancer Research, 2013, Wegiel B et al). We
found that CO doses of 100 ppm daily or twice per week were the most
effective in suppressing A549 xenograft tumors growth, Ki67 expression
and increased cleaved caspase-3 staining. Additionally, we found that
inhibition of xenografts and KRAS-driven lung tumor growth in response to
CO was associated with increased expression of M1 macrophage markers
(CD86, CD197, RANTES) and decreased M2 markers (MMR) and HO-1 blockage.
We demonstrated a direct interaction between HO-1 and Notch1. Further,
that CO promotes Notch 1 cleavage as well as phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in
the stroma cells, which are the markers of M1 polarization. Moreover, we
demonstrated a significant correlation between low HO-1 expression and
high p-ERK expression in primary human lung cancers (n = 30 patients). In
summary, we describe a mechanism by which CO affects cancer growth
through regulation of macrophage polarization via Notch1 and Erk1/2
pathways.
