Title: Deficiency of cystathionine beta synthase gene does not affect
tumor formation and survival of E-myc mice


Aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of many types of cancers.
S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) is a strong inhibitor of DNA
methytransferases. Deficiency of cystathionine beta synthase gene (Cbs)
causes elevation of AdoHcy in variety of tissues. Here we have generated
an E-myc mouse model which is either wild type, heterozygous or
homozygous for a deletion allele of Cbs (E myc+ Cbs+/+; E myc+ Cbs+/; E
myc+ Cbs/). Homozygous Cbs deficient mice in both E myc+ and E myc
background were born at Mendelian frequency indicating that there is no
synthetic lethality between Cbs and E myc. In aging, we observed no
significant difference in survival of E myc+ Cbs+/+, E myc+ Cbs+/ and E
myc+ Cbs/ mice (Median survival of 150, 149 and 117 days respectively).
However, preliminary data shows that tumor tissue from E myc+ Cbs/
animals has greatly elevated levels of AdoHcy compared to other
genotypes. Our studies suggest that elevated levels of AdoHcy has no
effect on tumor formation in E myc mice.
