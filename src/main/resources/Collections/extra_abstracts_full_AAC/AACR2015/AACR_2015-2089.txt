Title: Role of Cdx2 in maintainining differentiated chromatin structure
during tumor progression


Tumor progression often coincides with the appearance of tumor cells with
dedifferentiated or stem-like properties; the ontogeny of these cells is
unclear, but they are thought to carry a more malignant capacity than
their differentiated counterparts. Cdx2 is a transcriptional factor that
specifies cell fate of the intestinal epithelium. Epigenetic studies have
demonstrated that Cdx2 loss alters chromatin structure in the intestinal
epithelium. Cdx2 loss is often observed during colon tumor progression
and is correlated with de-differentiation. Our current study is aimed to
test the hypothesis that the Cdx2 prevents tumor progression by
maintaining the tumor epigenome. To this end, we have generated two mouse
models to determine the effect of Cdx2 loss on chromatin structure in a
tumorigenic environment and in primary tumors. Our current studies are
aimed at comparing Cdx2 binding sites on the genome in a normal and
tumorigenic environment, and in defining how Cdx2 loss affects chromatin
structure in primary tumors. These studies will shed light on how
alterations in chromatin structure can contribute to the epigenomic
mechanisms of colon tumor progression.Note: This abstract was not
