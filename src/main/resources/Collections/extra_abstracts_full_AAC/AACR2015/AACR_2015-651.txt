Title: Superior anti-tumor activity compared to T-DM1 in preclinical
studies of targeted therapies for her2-positive cancers by a novel
her2-ADC ZV0201


ZV0201 is a her2-targeting ADC based on newly developed K-Lock technology
at Concortis. Anti-her2 Antibody ZV02 was conjugated with highly
cytotoxic auristatin analogue through a non-cleavable linker to form
ZV0201,which mainly consists of DAR2 species. Biochemical analysis
indicated that ZV0201 was homogeneous and displayed as a single
population after purification. In cellular assay, enhanced anti-tumor
activities were observed with this conjugate, compared to T-DM1 in a
variety of tumor cell lines. ZV0201 was especially active in cells
expressing medium to low level of Her-2. In PK study, ZV0201 had an IC50
about 3-4 days in mouse and was stable for up to 7 days in sera from
different species. In xenograft models, a single dose of ZV0201 at low
levels completely wiped out the tumors and kept it down for up to 100
days, outperformed T-DM1. Toxicity analysis in rats showed less or
comparable toxic effect to that of T-DM1. ZV0201 is currently under
further evaluation as a candidate for clinical treatment of her2-positive
cancers.
