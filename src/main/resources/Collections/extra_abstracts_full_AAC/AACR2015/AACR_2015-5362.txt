Title: Andrographolide inhibits prostate cancer by modulating chemokine
and cytokines


Treatment options for androgen independent prostate cancer (PCa) are
limited. Hence, new treatment strategies are needed to treat/prevent
hormone refractory advance disease. Major focus of this study was to
develop non-toxic therapeutic/preventive option for PCa. Andrographolide
(AG), a bioactive diterpenoid isolated from Andrographis paniculata
showed dose and time dependent inhibition of PCa cells (PC3, DU145 and
LNCaP). This inhibition in growth was due to selective modulation of
chemokines and cytokines required for PCa cell growth and proliferation.
Specifically, CXCR3 and CXCR7 expression was reduced after AG treatment.
Interestingly, AG inhibited IL-6 expression, which is known to be
associated with advance PCa and also highly produced by the aggressive
PCa cell compared to less aggressive or normal prostatic epithelial
cells. Hence, AG may be offered as a new therapeutic/preventive agent
against PCa due to its ability to inhibit key chemokines and cytokines
required for PCa progression and supporting hormone refractory PCa.
