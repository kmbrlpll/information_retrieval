Title: Association of FUT2 gene variant, gut bacteria and colorectal
adenomas


The fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) gene is responsible for the expression of
the ABO blood group antigens. These antigens serve as anchors for a
variety of microbes in the gut and may confer increased susceptibility to
microbial infections and diseases. We assessed the association between a
genetic variant in the FUT2 gene (rs516246) and mucosal-adherent gut
bacteria in relation to colorectal adenomas. Genomic DNA from 200
consented screening colonoscopy subjects was genotyped for FUT2 rs516246
using a TaqMan genotyping assay. qPCR was performed to target the 16S
rRNA gene for specific bacteria. Statistical analysis included t-test,
logistic regression Chi-squared tests and Spearman's correlation test.
Results show that, except for age and waist-hip ratio, patient
characteristics were similar for cases and controls. Higher abundance of
E. coli and Eubacteria was associated with adenoma status. There was a
null association between FUT2 genotype and adenomas. Similarly, gut
bacteria and adenoma status was not strongly influenced by FUT2 genotype.
In conclusion: the FUT2 (rs516246) gene variant does not appear to
influence the relationship between gut bacteria and colorectal adenomas.
