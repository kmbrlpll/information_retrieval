Title: Levels and enzyme activity of CD73 in primary samples from cancer
patients


CD73 is an ectonucleotidase that converts extracellular AMP to Adenosine.
Within the tumor microenvironment, adenosine produced by CD73 is believed
to have an immunosuppressive effect upon anti-tumor immunity. CD73 is
found on lymphoid and myeloid cells, and blockade of this enzyme has been
shown to alter the suppressive capacity of cells. Expression of surface
CD73 as well as soluble CD73(sCD73) levels were measured in serum,
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and tumor samples from healthy and
cancer patient donors. Enzymatic activity of both surface CD73 and sCD73
was determined and differences in levels across varying tumor types and
disease status were quantified. In addition, CD73 levels and activity
were measured after incubation or treatment with anti-CD73 antibody,
MEDI9447. These studies suggest a potential role of surface and sCD73 as
a pharmacodynamic and/ or predictive biomarker of anti-CD73 immunotherapy.
