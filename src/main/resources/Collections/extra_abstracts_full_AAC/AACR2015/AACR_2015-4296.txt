Title: Dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in dendritic cell deletion
mice


Dendritic cells (DC) located in lamina propria are critical for
converting to CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells from CD4+Foxp3- in the
presence of retinoic acid and TGF-beta. However, role of DC and Treg in
immunological tolerance with commensal bacteria is still controversial.
To address this question, we bred constitutively CD11c+ DC-depleted mice
on C57BL/6 background. Although CD4+ T cells isolated from splenocytes
showed normal in vitro differentiation into Th1 and Th17 cells, these
DC-depleted mice were more protective than that of control against
dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) -induced colitis. Treg expression level of
DC-depleted mice was lower than that of control and not changed even
after colitis. These results suggest that other cell populations regulate
gastrointestinal system in both static and chronic inflammatory state in
DC-depleted mice.
