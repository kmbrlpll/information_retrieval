Title: BRE: a genetic interactor of BRCA2


Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2
predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancers. Though BRCA
associated tumor tissues showed inactivation of both alleles, in primary
cells mutations in both copies affect cell viability. This suggests that
BRCA1 or 2 loss mediated tumorigenesis process needs other factors. In
this study, MSCV (Murine Stem Cell Virus) retroviral mediated insertional
mutagenesis approach was used in conditional Brca2 mutant mES (mouse
embryonic stem) cells to identify and characterize genetic interactors of
BRCA2. One of the factors identified in this screen is brain and
reproductive organ expressed protein BRE. BRE is an anti-apoptotic
protein and also a component of the BRCA1-A complex that specifically
recognizes Lys-63-linked ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA
lesions sites. Overexpression of BRE results into perturbation of DNA
damage induced G1/S cell cycle checkpoint by preventing DNA damage
induced degradation of CDC25a phosphatase. Further it was found that the
stabilization of CDC25a phosphatase in BRE overexpressing cells on DNA
damage is mediated via ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 7 (USP7).
We are now examining the expression of BRE and CDC25a in BRCA2 deficient
tumors.
