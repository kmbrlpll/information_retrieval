Title: Endoglin regulation of Smad2/3 function mediates beclin1
expression and endothelial autophagy during angiogenesis


Autophagy is the targeted degradation of proteins and organelles critical
for homeostasis and cell survival. Transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-beta) is known to differentially regulate autophagy under distinct
physiological conditions by inducing inhibitory, stimulatory, or a
combination of these opposing signaling pathways. Importantly, how
TGF-beta signaling controls autophagic responses in the endothelial cell
(EC) system during angiogenesis remains unknown. Here we identified
endoglin, an EC-specific TGF-beta co-receptor essential for angiogenesis,
as a key determinant of autophagy. We found that Smad2/3 are major
transcriptional regulators of basal autophagy that specifically target
beclin1 (BECN1) gene expression. Selectively blocking ALK5 activation or
silencing endogenous Smad2/3 markedly increased BECN1 expression whereas
altering ALK1/Smad1/5/8 signaling had no effect. Endoglin potentiates
basal autophagy by suppressing ALK5/Smad2/3 activation. Notably,
increased beclin1 levels upon Smad2/3 knockdown directly correlated with
enhanced autophagy during angiogenesis. Taken together, these results
establish endoglin as a critical mediator of autophagy and demonstrate a
new cellular mechanism by which Smad2/3 inhibits angiogenesis.
