Title: An antibody drug conjugate (ADC) directed to lymphocyte antigen 6
complex, locus E (LY6E) delivers targeted chemotherapy to a wide range of
solid tumor malignancies


Chemotherapies are limited by a narrow therapeutic index resulting in
suboptimal exposure of the tumor to the drug and acquired tumor
resistance. One approach to overcome this is through Antibody Drug
Conjugates (ADCs); that facilitate greater potency via target specific
chemotherapy delivery. In this study, we used a bioinformatics approach
to identify Lymphocyte antigen 6, locus E, (LY6E), an
interferon-inducible glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked cell
membrane protein, as a promising ADC target. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed LY6E was overexpressed in a number of tumor types, such as,
breast, including triple negative breast cancer, lung, gastric, ovarian,
pancreatic and head/neck carcinomas. Characterization of the endocytic
pathways for LY6E revealed rapid uptake of the LY6E specific antibody
into cells leading to lysosomal accumulation. Consistent with this, a
LY6E specific ADC inhibited in vitro cell proliferation and produced
durable tumor regression in vivo in high LY6E expressing cancers. Our
results identify LY6E as a highly promising molecular ADC target for a
variety of solid tumor types with current unmet medical need.
