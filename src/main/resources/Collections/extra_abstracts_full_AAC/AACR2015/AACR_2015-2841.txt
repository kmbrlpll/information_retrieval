Title: A co-clinical assessment of patterns of BRAF inhibitor resistance


Multiple mechanisms conferring resistance of melanomas to BRAF inhibitors
have been described, yet the basis of resistance in a sizeable portion of
patient samples remains undefined. To address this gap, we characterized
patients baseline, on-treatment, and resistant tumors on both the protein
and RNA levels. By RNA-sequencing, we identified known
resistance-conferring mutations in 50% (6/12) of the resistant samples.
In parallel, targeted proteomic analysis by protein array categorized the
resistant samples into three stable groups: two that reactivate MAPK
signaling to different levels, and one that is MAPK-independent. The
molecular relevance of these categories was supported by both mutation
data and the similarity of resistance patterns that emerged in a
co-clinical trial in a novel genetically engineered mouse model.
Additionally, we have defined biomarkers in pre- and early-treatment
patient samples that have potential for predicting clinical responses. On
the basis of these observations, we suggest that BRAF inhibitor-resistant
melanomas can be actionably categorized using protein patterns, even
without the identification of the underlying genetic alteration.
