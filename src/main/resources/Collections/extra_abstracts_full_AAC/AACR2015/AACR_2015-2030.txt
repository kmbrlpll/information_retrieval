Title: FRK regulates glioma cell progression by promoting
N-cadherin/-catenin complex formation


Fyn-related kinase (FRK), a member of Src-related tyrosine kinases, is
recently reported to function as a potent tumor suppressor in several
cancer types. Our previous studies has also shown that FRK
over-expression inhibited the migration/invasion, proliferation and
promoted apoptosis of glioma cells. However, the mechanism of FRK on
glioma cell migration/invasion, proliferation and apoptosis is still not
clear. In this study, we found that FRK over-expression increased the
protein level of N-cadherin, but not that of E-cadherin. Meanwhile, FRK
over-expression promoted -catenin translocation to the plasma membrane,
where it formed complex with N-cadherin, while inhibited -catenin
translocation to the nucleus. In addition, down-regulation of N-cadherin
by siRNA promoted the migration/ invasion proliferation and inhibited
apoptosis of glioma U251 and U87 cells. Interestingly, N-cadherin
down-regulation abolished the effect of FRK on glioma cell
migration/invasion, proliferation and apoptosis. In summary, these
results indicate that FRK regulates glioma cell progression by promoting
N-cadherin/-catenin complex formation.
