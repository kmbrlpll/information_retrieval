Title: Ionizing radiation regulates mutant p53-mediated cancer cell
invasiveness through targeting cyclin D1


Ionizing radiation (IR) is widely used as a main treatment for solid
tumors, however, its potential influence and its role in the invasion and
metastasis of cancer still remain unknown. In this study, we found that
IR showed an inhibitory effect on the invasion of mutant p53 expressing
cancer cells through targeting cyclin D1, which has been known as
implicated in invasion and metastasis. Our data showed that
gamma-irradiation (5 Gy) decreased trans-well migration of mutant p53
expressing cancer cells. It has been reported that following exposure to
IR cyclin D1 is rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin pathway. We showed
that IR-induced cyclin D1 degradation is restored after 24 hr in H1299
p53 negative cells. In contrast, cyclin D1 depletion was not recovered in
H1299 mutant p53 cells, suggesting its inhibiting effect on cyclin D1
regulation. In addition, the levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 were
decreased in mutant p53 expressing cancer cells, indicating the reduction
of cell migration and invasion. These data indicate that IR suppresses
the restoration of cyclin D1 via the mutant p53, thus inhibiting the
invasion of cancer cells expressing mutant p53.
