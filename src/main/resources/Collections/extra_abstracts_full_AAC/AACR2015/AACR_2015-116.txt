Title: Targeting EZH2 catalytic independent functions in breast cancer


Advances in drug discovery have enabled the development of catalytic
inhibitors or inhibitors that disrupt protein-protein interactions. One
validated drug target is the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which
promotes cancer development and reduces patient survival in multiple
cancers. The core of PRC2 consists of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2)
and Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED). Currently, inhibitors targeting
the catalytic site of EZH2 were efficacious in inhibiting a subset of
blood cancers. In addition, a recently developed peptidomimetic inhibitor
that disrupts the EED-EZH2 interaction also inhibits PRC2 activity and
decreases proliferation of solid tumors. In this study, we investigated
the effects of EZH2 protein depletion versus EZH2 catalytic inhibition
with two small molecule inhibitors, GSK126 (an EZH2 catalytic inhibitor)
and DZNep (a histone methylation inhibitor that depletes EZH2). We found
that catalytic inhibition of EZH2 was insufficient to block cancer cell
proliferation whereas depletion of EZH2 was effective at killing cancer
cells. This study suggests that depleting EZH2 to inhibit both catalytic
dependent and independent functions could be useful in the treatment of
solid tumors such as breast cancer.
