Title: Discovery of MAbs against difficult GPCRs, ion channels, and
transporters using the MPS Discovery Engine


Integral membrane proteins are important drug targets and monoclonal
antibodies (MAbs) directed against them are highly sought for therapeutic
purposes. However, the complex structure of membrane protein targets
makes the discovery of these MAbs especially challenging. To address this
need, we have developed the MPS Discovery Engine to enable the isolation,
characterization, and engineering of monoclonal antibodies for
challenging membrane protein targets, including GPCRs, ion channels, and
transporters. MPS harnesses the strength of Integral's 10+ years of
expertise in membrane protein expression and analysis, as well as
proprietary technologies including Lipoparticles for high concentration
membrane protein presentation and Shotgun Mutagenesis for comprehensive
epitope mapping and MAb optimization. Integral Molecular currently has a
pipeline of several dozen MAbs against complex membrane proteins that are
involved in a variety of diseases, including cancer, inflammation, pain,
and infectious diseases. There are currently no FDA-approved MAbs that
target GPCRs, ion channels, or transporters, and MPS provides a pathway
to these new and previously intractable targets.
