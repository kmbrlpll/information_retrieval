Title: FGF9 gene amplification can induce resistance to anti-EGFR therapy
in colorectal cancer


The prognosis of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) remains dismal.
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals are potent mitogens, morphogens,
and inducers of angiogenesis. Abnormal expression of FGF9 has been
observed in several malignancies and might result in uncontrolled cell
proliferation and carcinogenesis. However, limited information is
available regarding the role of FGF9 in CRC. In this study, amplification
of FGF9 gene was observed in 14/146 (9.6%) CRC specimens, using a TaqMan
copy number assay. FGF9-overexpressed CRC cell lines were created, and
FGF9-overexpression induced the resistance to anti-epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) therapy (cetuximab or lapatinib) via the FGF
receptor (FGFR) signal, which was cancelled by BGJ398, a pan-FGFR
inhibitor. In vivo, FGF9-overexpressed xenograft tumors were resistant to
cetuximab monotherapy and the combination with BGJ398 overcame the
resistance. Considering these results, FGF9 gene amplification may play
an important role in the resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in CRC and the
combination with an anti-FGFR inhibitor could overcome this resistance.
