Title: Targeting cholesterol for increased chemotherapy efficacy


The PI3K-AKT pro-survival signal present in most cancer cells is the
major obstacle to effective chemotherapies. However, most
chemotherapeutics targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway have undesirable side
effects. -cyclodextrin (CD) and its derivatives were found to diminish
PI3K-AKT activities in cancer cells with limited side effects. Treatments
of cultured cells with CD depleted cholesterol from the plasma membrane
abolishing their coated pits. Even though growth factors such as IGF1 and
insulin activated their receptors, their signals were not transduced to
downstream signals such as PI3K-AKT pro-survival pathway. The inhibitory
effect lasted as long as CD was present in the medium. Injected into a
mouse, CD attenuated IGF1-induced blood glucose drop for several hours.In
the absence of PI3K-AKT pro-survival signal, cells became sensitized to
mitochondria dependent cell death such as Bcl2 antagonists ABT-263 in
many epithelial cells and Fas and TRAIL in type II cells. In mice
carrying human cancer cells, the addition of HPCD (a derivative of CD) to
the 2-deoxyglucose & ABT-263 combination therapy, and to the TRAIL
therapy improved their efficacies.
