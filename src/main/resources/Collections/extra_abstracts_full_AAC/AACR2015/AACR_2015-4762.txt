Title: ITPKA expression in lung and other cancers, regulated via gene
body methylation, functions as an oncogene


Inositol-Trisphosphate 3-Kinase A (ITPKA), a kinase with limited tissue
distribution, is involved in inositol phosphate metabolism. We identified
ITPKA as up-regulated in lung and many other types of cancers. Using
gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrated by in
vitro and in vivo assays that ITPKA functions as an oncogene to drive the
development of lung cancer. We further showed that methylation level in
the ITPKA gene body is significantly higher in various types of primary
tumors than in corresponding non-malignant tissues, which was positively
correlated with its expression. Our study revealed that DNMT3B-mediated
methylation of the CpG island in ITPKA gene body regulates its expression
via modulation of the binding of transcription activator SP1 to the ITPKA
promoter. During the multistage pathogenesis of lung carcinoma, ITPKA
gene body methylation first appeared at the in situ carcinoma stage and
increased during disease progression. Thus ITPKA expression functions as
an oncogene in lung and other cancers. Highly specific and sensitive
expression and methylation of ITPKA was present in a wide range of tumor
types, suggesting that deregulation of ITPKA may function as a universal
or near universal hallmark of malignancy.
