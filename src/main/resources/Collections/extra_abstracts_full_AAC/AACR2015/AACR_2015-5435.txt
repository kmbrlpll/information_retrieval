Title: A bioluminescent assay for measuring glucose uptake


Glucose management is a key biological process. In adipose tissue and
skeletal muscle, decreased rates of glucose uptake commonly associated
with diabetes mellitus lead to chronic hyperglycemia and a wide array of
physiological damage. In contrast, the overexpression of glucose
transporters in cancer cells results in increased rates of glucose uptake
to support their high rates of proliferation. Thus, activators and
inhibitors of glucose uptake are useful for both diabetes management and
anticancer therapies. The standard method of assaying glucose uptake
involves addition of a radioactive glucose analog (2-deoxyglucose) and
measurement of the accumulation of the stable and impermeable
phosphorylated derivative, 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2DG6P). However,
radioactive assays are laborious, costly, and require special handling of
radioactive materials and waste. A simpler assay can be made by measuring
the production of NADPH through the oxidation of 2DG6P by
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. We have developed a bioluminescent
glucose uptake assay that is both rapid and convenient and exhibits a
larger signal window than comparable fluorescent or colorimetric
approaches. The utility of this assay will be demonstrated with both
cancer cells and insulin-sensitive 3T3L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes.
