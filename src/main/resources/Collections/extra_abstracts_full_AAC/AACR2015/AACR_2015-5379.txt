Title: A potent EZH2 inhibitor exhibits long residence time and
anti-tumor activity


The EZH2 histone methyltransferase is frequently mutated in diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma leading to increased trimethylation of histone H3 lysine
27 (H3K27me3). Drug discovery efforts have previously identified a
pyridone-based chemical series of EZH2 inhibitors that potently and
selectively inhibit EZH2 catalytic activity. These compounds are capable
of globally decreasing H3K27me3 levels, de-repressing EZH2 target genes,
and inducing growth inhibition of many lymphoma cell lines both in cell
culture and in vivo. Through medicinal chemistry optimization, we have
developed EZH2 inhibitors with significantly improved potency in both
biochemical and cellular assays. These compounds exhibit a prolonged
enzyme residence time that can be further extended in vitro through the
addition of an H3K27me3 peptide. Herein, we report the biochemical and
cellular activity of these new EZH2 inhibitors.
