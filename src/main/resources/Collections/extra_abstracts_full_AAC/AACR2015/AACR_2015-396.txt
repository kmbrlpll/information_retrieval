Title: Ibrutinib exerts potent antifibrotic activity in a mouse model of
pancreatic adenocarcinoma


Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a disease with a poor
prognosis characterized by a dense stromal fibroinflammatory reaction
that is a significant obstacle to effective therapy. The desmoplastic
stroma comprises many inflammatory cells, in particular mast cells that
are a key component of the PDAC microenvironment and whose infiltration
often correlates with poor patient outcome. Reducing the stroma is of key
importance for improving the standard of care. We have previously
successfully utilized ibrutinib, a clinically-approved Bruton's Tyrosine
Kinase inhibitor, as a mast cell blocker in a mouse model of cell
tumorigenesis. Here, we made use of a transgenic mouse model of PDAC and
patient derived xenografts (PDXs) to assess ibrutinib's impact on the
tumor microenvironment and animal survival. Across these various
experimental pre-clinical models, we show that ibrutinib significantly
diminishes tissue fibrosis, increases survival and improves the outcome
of standard care. Our results suggest that ibrutinib could be deployed to
one more type of cancer and open the way to new clinical trials assessing
its therapeutic impact in PDAC patients.
