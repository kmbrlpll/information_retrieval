Title: Evidence that MTAP acts as a genetic switch to inhibit tumor
formation


Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase (MTAP) deficiency is widely observed in
a variety of human tumor and tumor derived cell lines, suggesting that
MTAP may play a role in tumorigenesis. It is an enzyme that catalyzes
phosphorylation of 5deoxy-5-methylthioadenosine (MTA), a byproduct of in
vivo polyamine biosynthesis. To elucidate the mechanism by which MTAP
inhibits tumor formation, we created a MCF-7 breast cancer derived cell
line that expresses MTAP under a doxycycline (DOX) regulated promoter. In
this cell line MTAP expression was undetectable in the absence of DOX and
could be detected as early as 4 hours after DOX induction. MTAP
expression caused a decrease in cell proliferation, soft-agar colony
formation, and cell migration. Microarray studies revealed several genes
that were regulated by MTAP. For two of the genes that were identified,
AGPAT4 and IGFBP1, we examined the relationship between their mRNA levels
and MTAP mRNA levels by qRT-PCR. Surprisingly, a brief pulse of MTAP
expression was able to alter mRNA levels of these genes and this change
in mRNA persisted even when MTAP RNA levels were no longer detectable.
Our findings show that MTAP expression suppresses tumorigenesis and it
may act as a genetic switch.
