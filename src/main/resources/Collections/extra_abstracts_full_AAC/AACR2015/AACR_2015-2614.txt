Title: Targeting heat shock protein 90 with Ganetespib for the treatment
of lymphoma


Effective treatments for lymphoma remain a serious unmet medical need:
the incidence of lymphoma continues to rise, and lymphoma tumors can
relapse in patients who initially respond to treatment. Heat shock
protein 90 (HSP90) has become an attractive therapeutic target in
treating many many cancers, including blood cancers. In our study, we
show that ganetespib, a clinically promising and actively investigated
second-generation HSP90 inhibitor, dramatically reduced growth of a
couple of different kinds of lymphoma, such as mantle cell lymphoma and
Burkitt's lymphoma in a dose-dependent manner. It induced G2/M cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis in all studied cell lines, such as Ramos, Jeko-1,
Granta-519, Raji, etc. Ganetespib significantly inhibited growth of
xenograft tumors in vivo as a single agent or in combination with
doxorubicin. Results of H&E staining, TUNEL assays, and
immunohistochemistry staining of Ki-67 revealed significant differences
in ganetespib-treated tumors. Mechanistically, ganetespib caused
pronounced decrease of expression of classic HSP90 client proteins. In
summary, our data suggest that ganetespib can be potentially used for the
molecularly targeted therapy of lymphoma patients.
