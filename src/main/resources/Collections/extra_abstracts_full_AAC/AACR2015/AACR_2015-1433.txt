Title: CDKL2 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and breast cancer
progression


The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) confers mesenchymal
properties on epithelial cells and has been closely associated with the
acquisition of aggressive traits by epithelial cancer cells. To identify
novel regulators of EMT, we carried out cDNA screens that covered 500
human kinases. Subsequent characterization of candidate kinases led us to
uncover cyclin-dependent kinase-like 2 (CDKL2) as a novel potent promoter
for EMT and breast cancer progression. CDKL2-expressing human mammary
gland epithelial cells displayed enhanced mesenchymal traits and stem
cell-like phenotypes, which was acquired through activating a
ZEB1/E-cadherin/beta-catenin positive feedback loop and regulating CD44
mRNA alternative splicing to promote conversion of CD24-high cells to
CD44-high cells. Furthermore, CDKL2 enhanced primary tumor formation and
metastasis in a breast cancer xenograft model. Notably, CDKL2 is
expressed significantly higher in mesenchymal human breast cancer cell
lines than in epithelial lines, and its over-expression/amplification in
human breast cancers is associated with shorter disease-free survival.
Taken together, our study uncovered a major role for CDKL2 in promoting
EMT and breast cancer progression.
