Title: LncRNA ANRIL indicates a potential prognostic biomarker in gastric
cancer and promotes tumor growth by silencing of miR-99a/miR-449a


Long noncoding RNAs are involved in several kinds of cancers. Here, we
reported that ANRIL (CDKN2B-AS1), a 3.8-kb long noncoding RNA, recruiting
and binding to PRC2, was generally upregulated in human gastric cancer
(GC) tissues. In a cohort of 120 GC patients, the higher expression of
ANRIL was significantly correlated with higher TNM stages (P = 0.041) and
larger tumor sizes (P = 0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that ANRIL
expression served as an independent predictor for overall survival (OS)
(P = 0.036). Further experiments revealed that the knockdown of ANRIL
significantly repressed the proliferation of GC cell lines both in vitro
and in vivo. We also showed that E2F1 could induce ANRIL and
ANRIL-mediated growth promotion is partly due to epigenetic repression of
miR-99a/miR-449a in Trans (controlling the targets_mTOR and CDK6/E2F1
pathway) by binding to PRC2, thus forming a positive feedback loop,
continuing to promote GC cell proliferation. To our knowledge, this is
the first report which showed that the role of ANRIL in the progression
of GC and ANRIL could crosstalk with microRNAs in epigenetic level. Our
results suggest that ANRIL, as a growth regulator, may serve as a
potential prognostic biomarker and target for new therapies in human GC.
