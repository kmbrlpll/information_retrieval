Title: Kinetic mechanism of the lysine methyltransferase SMYD3 using
MAP3K2 protein substrate


Dysregulation of DNA and histone methylation has been shown to play
fundamental roles in carcinogenesis. Recently however, protein
methylation in the cytoplasm has been linked to oncogenic Ras signaling.
Mazur and colleagues demonstrated that SMYD3 (SET and MYND domain
containing protein 3), a primarily cytoplasmic protein methyltransferase,
can methylate MAP3K2 using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as a cofactor
(Mazur et al. 2014. Nature 510(7504):283-7). Methylation by SMYD3
preserves the active, phosphorylated state of MAP3K2 sustaining
activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/ signaling module and potentiating
formation of Ras-driven cancers. Here, we characterized the kinetic
mechanism of SMYD3 using MAP3K2 protein as a substrate. SMYD3 activity
was measured with a radiometric assay using 3H-SAM. Initial velocity,
product and dead-end inhibitor studies indicate that SMYD3 uses a random
kinetic mechanism where both SAM and MAP3K2 can bind apo-SMYD3. This was
supported by substrate and ligand binding assays using SPR. Together,
these studies elucidate the kinetic mechanism of SMYD3 with MAP3K2 and
provide a context for inhibitor development.
