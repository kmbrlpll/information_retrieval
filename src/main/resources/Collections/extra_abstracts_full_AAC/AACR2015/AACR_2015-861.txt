Title: The association between cancer prevention guidelines and cancer
risk in the Southern Community Cohort Study


Background: Public health and cancer prevention guidelines recommend
healthy behaviors to decrease overall cancer risk. The impact of cancer
prevention guidelines on cancer incidence has been rarely studied in
low-income Whites and African Americans.Design: We quantified the
association of meeting current American Cancer Society cancer prevention
guidelines, as measured by non-smoking, none to moderate alcohol intake,
higher diet quality, and regular physical activity with total and
site-specific cancer incidence. Data were obtained at enrollment from
73,022 adults age 40-79, without a previous cancer diagnosis,
participating in the Southern Community Cohort Study. The Southern
Community Cohort Study is a prospective cohort study that enrolled
participants during 2002-2009, in 12 southeastern US states via Community
Health Centers (86%) or stratified random sampling of the general
population (14%). Fifty-six percent of the cohort has a household
income0.10).Conclusions: Meeting current public health guidelines is
associated with substantial reductions in cancer incidence. This study
provides support for individual lifestyle modification to reduce cancer
incidence in this under-served population.
