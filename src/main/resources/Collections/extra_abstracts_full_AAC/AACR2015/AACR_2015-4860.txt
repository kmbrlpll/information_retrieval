Title: Detection of genetically distinct subclones in cancer: a novel NGS
algorithm with high spatial and genetic resolution


Despite the large number of genome data banks, reference sequences are
not always the best match for high-throughput analysis. This is
especially true in studies of intratumor heterogeneity where increased
mutation rates are observed; the use of a reference genome can complicate
the interpretation of the results. Current techniques attempt to
circumvent this obstacle by applying de novo assembly algorithms, but the
process is slow and often without viable results. Here, we introduce a
new technique to decrease the dependency of these pipelines on reference
sequences. Our clone discovery algorithm takes advantage of existing
alignment data and correlates distant mutations, reported by an alignment
algorithm. The algorithm makes no statistical assumption; it extracts
information from the overlapping alignments in a step-wise fashion, using
reference coordinates of aligned reads. Due to the randomness of noise,
the algorithm can be very sensitive and identify clones of low frequency.
