Title: Allele-specific modulation of cancer metabolism by a long
noncoding RNA


Altered energy metabolism is a cancer hallmark as malignant cells tailor
their metabolic pathways to meet their energy requirements. Glucose and
glutamine are the two major nutrients that fuel cellular metabolism and
the pathways utilizing these nutrients are often altered in cancer. In
this study we show that the long non-codingRNA CCAT2, located at 8q24
amplicon on cancer risk associated rs6983267 SNP, regulates cancer
metabolism in vitro and in vivo, in an allele-specific manner by binding
the cleavage factor I (CFIm) complex with distinct affinities,
complementary to the risk for colon cancer. The newly formed RNA:protein
complex, CCAT2:CFIm, regulates the alternative splicing of glutaminase 1
(GLS1) by selecting the poly(A) site in intron 14 of the precursor mRNA.
This results in the preferential expression of the GAC, the more
catalytically active GLS1 isoform. Our findings, supported by data in
human colorectal cancer samples from multiple cohorts, including TCGA
dataset, and multiple animal models, uncover complex mechanisms of cancer
metabolism regulation controlled by a long non-codingRNA.
