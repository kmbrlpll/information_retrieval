Title: MRAS and SHOC2 interact with SCRIB and coordinate ERK pathway
activation with polarity and tumorigenic growth


SHOC2 is mutated in Noonan syndrome and plays a key role in the
activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway, which is upregulated in the majority
of human cancers. SHOC2 functions as a PP1-regulatory protein and as an
effector of MRAS. Here we show that SHOC2 and MRAS form a complex with
SCRIB, a polarity protein with tumor suppressor properties. SCRIB
functions as a PP1-regulatory protein and antagonizes SHOC2-mediated RAF
dephosphorylation through a mechanism involving competition for PP1
molecules within the same macromolecular complex. SHOC2 function is
selectively required for the malignant properties of tumor cells with
mutant RAS, and both MRAS and SHOC2 play a key role in polarized
migration. We propose that MRAS, through its ability to recruit a complex
with paradoxical components, coordinates ERK pathway spatiotemporal
dynamics with polarity and that this complex plays a key role during
tumorigenic growth.
