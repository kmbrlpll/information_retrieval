Title: Akt2 and acid ceramidase cooperate to induce malignant
transformation


The ability of Akt 2 and acid ceramidase (ASAH1) to cooperate and induce
malignant transformation is not known. Here we show that in immortalized,
non-transformed cells, ectopic co-expression of Akt2 and ASAH1 is
significantly more effective than expression of each gene alone at
inducing cell invasion and at conferring resistance to apoptosis.
Consistent with these observations, siRNA-mediated depletion of both Akt2
and ASAH1 is much more potent than depleting each alone at inhibiting
cell viability/proliferation and cell invasion. Furthermore,
pharmacological inhibitors of Akt (TCN or MK-2206) and ASAH1 (B13)
synergize to inhibit cell viability/proliferation, and combinations of
these drugs are more effective than single agent treatments at inhibiting
cell invasion. Taken together, the results suggest that these two enzymes
cooperate to induce malignant transformation and warrant further
preclinical studies to evaluate the potential of combining inhibitors of
Akt and ASAH1 to treat cancer.
