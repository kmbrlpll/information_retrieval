Title: Long noncoding RNA HOTAIR is targeted and regulated by
microRNA-141 in renal carcinoma cells


HOTAIR is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which interacts with the
Polycomb Repressive Complex and suppresses its target genes. HOTAIR has
also been demonstrated to promote malignancy. MicroRNA-141 (miR-141) has
been reported to play a role in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT) process and the expression of miR-141 is inversely correlated with
tumorigenicity and invasiveness in several human cancers. We found that
HOTAIR expression is inversely correlated to miR-141 expression in renal
carcinoma cells. HOTAIR promotes malignancy including proliferation and
invasion whereas miR-141 suppresses malignancy in renal carcinoma cells.
miR-141 binds to HOTAIR in a sequence specific manner, and suppresses
HOTAIR expression and functions including proliferation and invasion.
Both HOTAIR and miR-141 were associated with the immunoprecipitated
Argaunaute2 (Ago2) complex and the Ago2 complex cleaved HOTAIR in the
presence of miR-141. These results demonstrate that HOTAIR is suppressed
by miR-141 in an Ago2 dependent manner.
