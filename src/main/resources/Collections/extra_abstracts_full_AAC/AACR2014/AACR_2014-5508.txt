Title: Bromodomain and hegdehog pathway targets in small cell lung cancer


Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an extremely aggressive cancer that
frequently recurs after conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. SCLC is a
neuroendocrine lung malignancy for which there is no effective treatment
that affects >200,000 people world-wide every year with a very high
mortality rate (-4-fold more sensitive to JQ1 than the lines without Myc
amplification while the L-Myc over-expressing lines were >-3-fold more
sensitive and the n-Myc over-expressing lines were >-9-fold more
sensitive to JQ1 than the lines without Myc amplification. Concentration
response experiments with the same 24 SCLC lines were carried out with
the Hedgehog pathway inhibitors HPI1, SEN-450, LDE225 (erismodegib;
clinical Cmax = 9 uM) and GDC0049 (vismodegib; clinical Cmax = 34 uM).
The SCLC lines which over-express Myc were more sensitive to the 4
hedgehog pathway inhibitors than were the lines without Myc
amplification. Although the 6 c-Myc over-expressing lines had higher
levels of SMO gene expression than the other SCLC lines, they were not
different in sensitivity to the SMO inhibitors than the other Myc
over-expressing lines. Further studies of SCLC lines response to
investigational agents are underway.
