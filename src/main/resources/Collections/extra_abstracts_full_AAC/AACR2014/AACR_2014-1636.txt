Title: NMR discovery and molecular-basis of small molecule inhibitors of
STAT3


Hyperactivation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3) transcription factor is a critical molecular anomaly that
promotes the constitutive transcription of pro-oncogenic genes in many
tumor cells. Therefore, the direct inhibition of STAT3 signaling is a
promising strategy to treat cancer. However, targeting transcription
factors with small molecule drugs has proved to be challenging. To
facilitate the generation of inhibitor leads with good ADME (absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion) attributes, we employed
fragment-based screening by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)
in conjunction with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to
identify small molecule inhibitors of STAT3. The inhibitors confer
specificity for STAT3; inhibit the activation and nuclear accumulation of
STAT3; inhibit STAT3 transcription of cell cycle regulatory genes and the
proliferation of STAT3-dependent cancer cell lines. We have used
two-dimensional methyl NMR of STAT3 to reveal atomic resolution insights
on the basis for inhibition. Our results establish an innovative approach
to targeting STAT3 that may also be applied to other transcription
factors associated with cancer and other diseases.
