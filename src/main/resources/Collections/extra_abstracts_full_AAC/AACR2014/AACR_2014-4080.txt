Title: Smad and NFAT pathways cooperate to regulate CD103 expression in
human CD8 T lymphocytes and TCR-mediated epithelial tumor cell killing


The interaction of integrin E(CD103)7, often expressed on
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), with epithelial cell marker
E-cadherin on tumor cell surface plays a major role in antitumor
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. CD103 is encoded by ITGAE gene
and is induced in CD8 T cells upon T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement and
exposure to transforming growth factor (TGF)-1, abundant within the tumor
microenvironment. However, the transcriptional mechanisms underlying the
cooperative role of these two signaling pathways in inducing CD103
expression in CD8 T cells remain unknown. Using a model system based on a
CD8+/CD103- T-cell clone, we demonstrated that the transcription factors
Smad2/3 and NFAT-1 are required for CD103 induction on T lymphocytes
activated with a combination of TGF-1 and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies.
We also identified the promotor and enhancer elements of human ITGAE
gene, and showed that Smad2/3 and NFAT-1 are necessary for the activity
of the ITGAE enhancer, and thus for CD103 expression. Overall, our
results explain how TGF-1 induces CD103 expression on locally activated
CD8 T cells, thus contributing to antitumor CTL responses and malignant
cell killing.
