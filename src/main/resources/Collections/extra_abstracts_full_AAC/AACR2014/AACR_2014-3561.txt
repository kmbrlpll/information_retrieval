Title: Whole transcriptome analysis of testicular germ cell tumors


Next generation sequencing of the whole transcriptome enables high
resolution measurement of gene expression activity in different tissue
and cell types. This methodology provides an in depth study of known
transcripts and depending on the data analysis, allows identification of
additional transcript types such as transcript variants, fusion
transcripts, and small and long ncRNAs. In this study we performed
RNA-Seq using the Ion Torrent sequencing platform to compare the
expression profile of testicular germ cell tumors (seminoma type, n=3)
and normal testis (n=3). Using Partek Flow and Star or TopHat aligners,
we aligned the reads to the human genome and mapped sequences to the
RefSeq database. We identified a large number of genes that were up and
down regulated with high degree of significance p2X FC). These included
genes related to testicular tissue type, stem cell pleuripotency (NANOG;
POU5F1) and proliferation (KRAS, CCND2). In addition, a number of
differentially expressed noncoding RNAs were identified (SNORD12B, XIST).
The method was validated on a small set of genes (>20) using qPCR (TaqMan
Assays). We used the Open Array platform to quantitatively screen a
larger number of differentially expressed genes (224) across a number of
different testicular germ cell tumor types (non-seminoma).
