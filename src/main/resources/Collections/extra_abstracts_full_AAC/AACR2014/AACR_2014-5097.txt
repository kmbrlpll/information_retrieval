Title: Co-targeting of convergent, switchable nucleotide biosynthetic
pathways induces synthetic lethality in leukemia


Pharmacological targeting of metabolic processes in cancer must overcome
redundancy in biosynthetic pathways. Deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP)
can be produced by the de novo pathway (DNP) via ribonucleotide
reductase, and/or by the nucleoside salvage pathway (NSP) via
deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). The NSP's role in supporting tumor DNA
replication is unknown. Here we show that survival of acute lymphoblastic
leukemia cells upon inhibition of DNP-dependent dCTP production requires
a functional NSP. Thus, DNP inhibition triggers a compensatory switch to
NSP-mediated dCTP production. This metabolic switch can be imaged by
positron emission tomography, thereby providing a non-invasive method for
monitoring pharmacological targeting of the DNP. Blocking both DNP dCTP
production using thymidine and the switch to NSP using a new dCK
inhibitor induces replication stress overload and synthetic lethality in
leukemia cells, without significant host toxicity. This co-targeting
therapy may be broadly applicable against other malignancies
characterized by high levels of replication stress.
