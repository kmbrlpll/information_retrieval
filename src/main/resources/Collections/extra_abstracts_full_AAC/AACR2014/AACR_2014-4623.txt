Title: HDAC6 inhibition is a novel strategy to selectively impact
inflammatory breast cancer cell survival


Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a lethal and understudied variant of
breast cancer, presenting with a signature clinical phenotype of rapidly
metastasizing diffuse tumor emboli and rapid resistance to traditional
chemotherapeutics. In an unbiased, highthroughput search for novel genes
and therapeutics which specifically impact IBC cell survival, we
performed a genome wide shRNA screen on two IBC cell lines and identified
Histone Deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) as vital for IBC vs non-IBC breast cancer
cell line survival. In IBC vs non-IBC breast cancer cell lines,
individual knockdown of HDAC6 decreases cell viability and causes
apoptosis via cleaved PARP expression and annexin V assays. Importantly,
HDAC6 is a therapeutically viable candidate. The orally bioavailable next
generation HDAC6-selective inhibitor, Rocilinostat, also preferentially
impacts IBC vs non-IBC cell survival. We transitioned these findings in
vivo by treating a well-established mouse xenograft model of IBC with
Rocilinostat and found significant slowing of tumor growth rates. Taken
together, these data represent a new and tailored treatment option for
IBC.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.
