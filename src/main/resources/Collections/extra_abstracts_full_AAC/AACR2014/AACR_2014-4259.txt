Title: The radiogenomic landscape of cancer


Radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for many solid malignancies.
Despite this, there have not been extensive systematic analyses of the
correlation between therapeutic sensitivity and genomic parameters. To
accelerate discovery of patient-matched radiotherapy, or precision
radiotherapeutics, systematic approaches are needed to identify specific
genetic features that confer radiotherapeutic resistance and target these
features with small-molecule drugs. We have quantitatively measured the
sensitivity of 533 genomically characterized cancer cell lines to
radiation, uncovering novel and established genetic, lineage, chromosomal
copy number, and gene-expression-based dependencies. We show that small
molecules that target genetic alterations driving therapeutic resistance
effect genotype selective radiosensitization, establishing a preclinical
basis for personalized therapeutic regimens. This dataset is an important
resource that can be used to develop novel therapeutic hypotheses and to
accelerate discovery of drugs given concurrently with radiation matched
to patients by their cancer genotype, thereby enhancing efficacy and
limiting toxicity in the context of a new approach of precision
radiotherapy.
