Title: LC-MS/MS quantification of proteins CD47 and SIRPA in cell
subtypes selected by flow cytometry from blood


Flow cytometry and mass spectrometry are widely used analytical tools in
cancer research. Flow cytometry is known for cell counting, cell sorting
and cancer biomarker discovery. Mass spectrometry is unparalleled in its
ability to selectively detect and quantify target analytes at the
molecular level. The combination of flow cytometry to isolate specific
cell subtypes from biological fluids such as blood and mass spectrometry
to quantify proteins contained in the selected cells provides a new
approach to studying protein expression in specific cell subtypes. We
have used this combination to investigate the normal levels of CD47 and
SIRPA proteins in CB8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD14+ monocytes, CD33+
myeloid cells and CD56+ NK cells isolated from blood specimens as a first
step toward better understanding of how the CD47/SIRPA protein levels in
these cells are affected by cancer and cancer treatment.
