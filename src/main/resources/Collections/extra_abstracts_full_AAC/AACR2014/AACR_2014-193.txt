Title: Adipocytes, obesity and the multiple myeloma microenvironment


Multiple myeloma (MM), a hematological malignancy characterized by
monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, affects nearly 23,000
Americans per year. Obesity contributes to the development and
progression of multiple myeloma, yet the relationship between MM cells
and adipocytes found in the tumor microenvironment has not been fully
elucidated. To examine how adipocytes contribute to the growth and
progression of MM, we co-cultured human myeloma cell lines with primary
human adipocytes isolated from lipoaspirates. We found that MM cells
directly co-cultured with adipocytes or exposed to their conditioned
media had increased viability, angiogenic potential, invasion, colony
formation, and production of inflammatory cytokines, when compared to MM
cells alone. Moreover, adipocytes from obese individuals (BMI > 30)
further compounded this. Thus, we demonstrate an important role for
adipocytes in promoting myeloma pathologies.
