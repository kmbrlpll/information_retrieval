Title: A small molecule that binds and inhibits the ETV1 transcription
factor oncoprotein


Members of the ETS transcription factor family have been implicated in
several cancers, where they are often dysregulated by genomic
derangement. ETS variant 1 (ETV1) is an ETS factor gene that undergoes
chromosomal translocation in prostate cancers and Ewing's sarcomas,
amplification in melanomas, and lineage dysregulation in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors. Pharmacologic perturbation of ETV1 would be appealing in
these cancers; however, oncogenic transcription factors are often deemed
undruggable by conventional methods. Here, we used small-molecule
microarray (SMM) screens to identify and characterize drug-like compounds
that modulate the biological function of ETV1. We identified the
1,3,5-triazine small molecule BRD32048 as a top candidate ETV1
perturbagen. BRD32048 binds ETV1 directly, modulating both ETV1-mediated
transcriptional activity and invasion of ETV1-driven cancer cells.
Moreover, BRD32048 inhibits p300-dependent acetylation of ETV1, thereby
promoting its degradation. These results point to a new avenue for
pharmacological ETV1 inhibition and may inform a general means to
discover small molecule perturbagens of transcription factor
oncoproteins.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.
