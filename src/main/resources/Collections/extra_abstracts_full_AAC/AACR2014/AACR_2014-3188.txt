Title: Evaluation of clonal origin of malignant mesothelioma/polyclonal
origin of malignant mesothelioma


Tumors are generally thought to be monoclonal in origin, although this
paradigm stemmed decades ago mostly from the study of hematopoietic
malignancies and sarcomas. The clonal origin of malignant mesothelioma, a
deadly cancer resistant to the current therapies, has never been
investigated before. We used the HUMARA (human androgen receptor) assay
to examine the pattern of clonality in 14 sporadic and 2 familial
Malignant Mesotheliomas (MM). Of 16 specimens studied, 14 were
informative and nearly all (13/14) revealed two electrophoretically
distinct methylated HUMARA alleles, indicating a polyclonal origin for
these tumors. This discovery has important clinical implications, in that
an accurate assessment of tumor clonality is key to the design of novel
molecular strategies for the treatment of MM.
