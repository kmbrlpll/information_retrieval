Title: Deciphering the targets and mechanism of action of the natural
product Tonantzitlolone in clear cell renal cell carcinomas


Tonantzitlolone is a diterpene ester first extracted in 1990 from the
native Mexican plant Stillingia sanguinolutea (Euphorbiaceae), which
displays anti-tumor activity. Although its structure and total synthesis
have been elucidated, its cellular target(s) and potential mechanism of
action remain unknown. We identified Tonantzitlolone as a dual PKC and
PKC activator in vitro. However in clear cell renal cell carcinoma
(CCRCC), its activity was mostly PKC-dependent. Through activation of
PKC, Tonantzitlolone induced an insulin-resistant phenotype by inhibiting
IRS1 and the PI3K/Akt pathway. Simultaneously, Tonantzitlolone activated
the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), driving glucose
dependency. Thus, similar to the selective PKC activator Englerin A,
Tonantzitlolone induces a metabolic catastrophe in CCRCC, starving the
cells of glucose while increasing their glycolytic dependency, ultimately
leading to cell death.
