Title: Ethanol enhances arsenic-induced mutagenesis in colon


Health effects due to environmental exposure to arsenic are a major
health concern world-wide. Arsenic has been known to induce
carcinogenesis and enhance tumor development via complex and unclear
mechanism. As one of the common nutritional factors, ethanol is also a
well-documented risk factor for many malignancies. However, little is
known on the effects of co-exposure to arsenic and ethanol in mutagenesis
and carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigate the mutagenic effect of
co-exposure to arsenic and ethanol in vivo and in vitro. Results show
that ethanol could markedly enhance arsenic-induced mutagenesis in colon
in Big Blue Mice. This response related to intracellular reactive oxygen
species (ROS) generation, NAPDH oxidase activation, and DNA damage/repair
functional changes.We conclude that ethanol enhances arsenic-induced
mutagenesis in colon in vivo. These results indicated that alcohol
consumption should be taken into consideration in the investigation on
arsenic-induced carcinogenesis in arsenic-exposure population.
