Title: Kinase domain activation of FGFR2 yields high-grade lung
adenocarcinoma sensitive to a pan-FGFR inhibitor in a mouse model of NSCLC


Somatic mutations in Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) have
been found in 4-5% of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). FGFR2 and other FGFR kinase family gene alterations have been
found in lung squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and other
malignancies though mouse models of FGFR driven lung cancers have not
been reported. Here, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model
(GEMM) of NSCLC driven by a kinase domain mutation in FGFR2. Combined
with p53 ablation, primary grade III/IV adenocarcinoma was induced in the
lung epithelial compartment exhibiting locally invasive and pleiotropic
tendencies largely made up of multinucleated cells. Tumors were acutely
sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of FGFR signaling. In preliminary
studies tumors also responded to Programmed death pathway immune
checkpoint blockade using anti-PD-1 antibody arguing for activated immune
evasion mechanisms in this model.This is the first autochthonous
FGFR2-driven lung cancer GEMM that can be applied across different cancer
indications in a preclinical setting.
