Title: TAZ (WWTR1), a key transcription co-activator of hippo-pathway,
promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression via PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway


Introduction: The contact inhibition of proliferation is crucial for
well-controlled organogenesis. Its disruption results in sustained cell
proliferation, which is a hallmark of solid tumors. The Hippo signaling
pathway has been implicated in contact inhibition of proliferation. Here,
we investigated the role of TAZ (WWTR1), a key transcription co-activator
of hippo-pathway, in HCC progression. Methods and Results: In HCC
patients, the high TAZmRNA expression examined by real time PCR showed
worsen survival outcomes compared with low expression group.
Additionally, the tumor size in High TAZmRNA expression group was
significantly larger than that in low expression group, and its high
protein expression in HCC was deeply associated with the cell
proliferative activity. A knockdown of TAZ expression in HCC cell lines
attenuated the cell growth accompanying the downstream gene expressions
(CTGF and CYR61). As the TAZ-mediated signaling pathway in cell growth, a
knockdown of TAZ expression using RNAi inactivated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway. Conclusion: Thus, TAZ plays a crucial role in tumor progression
by accelerating cell growth via a PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and tumoral
TAZmRNA expression level may be a useful prognostic biomarker in HCC.
