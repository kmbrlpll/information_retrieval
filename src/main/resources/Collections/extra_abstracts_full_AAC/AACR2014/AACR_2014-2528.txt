Title: Optimization of small molecules targeting BMI1 protein expression.
Part 2. Improved potency, oral bioavailability, and in vivo efficacy of
amino-pyrazines and amino-pyridines


Earlier, in our efforts to identify molecules that selectively deplete
tumor stem cells, we discovered and elaborated on a series of
amino-thiazoles. These first-in-class small molecule inhibitors reduce
the activity and levels of BMI1 protein in vitro and in vivo (see the
preceding poster).Through our medicinal chemistry efforts, we developed a
second generation of molecules that reduce levels of BMI1. In this new
scaffold, the central thiazole ring has been replaced with a pyrazine or
pyridine ring. There is a clear relationship between the structure of the
central heterocycle and the ability of the compound to decrease the level
of BMI1 protein.The most beneficial modification on the right wing of the
molecule is the introduction of benzimidazole moiety. As a result,
analogs with markedly improved oral bioavailability have been
identified.The structure activity relationship on the left ring parallels
the SAR observed with the amino-thiazole scaffold.The most successful
analogs in this series can be dosed orally and demonstrate dose-dependent
efficacy in mouse xenograft models including the HT1080 and L1210 cell
lines.
