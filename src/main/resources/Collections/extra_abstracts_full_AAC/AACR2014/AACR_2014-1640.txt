Title: A novel small molecule inhibitor of lysophosphatidic acid
acyltransferase-beta inhibits pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and
mTOR signaling


Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT-), a phosphatidic acid
(PA)-generating enzyme, plays an essential role in triglyceride
synthesis. A less familiar role for LPAAT- is that of a regulator of cell
growth and differentiation by means of the function of its product, PA,
which plays a vital role in the activation of key signal transduction
proteins including Raf, PKC- and mTOR. It is in this role that LPAAT-
presents as a potential therapeutic target in cancer. Accordingly, we
developed a library of small molecule inhibitors of LPAAT- with nanomolar
activity against LPAAT- enzyme activity in vitro (2012 Annual Meeting,
Abstract #2470). We have now performed additional SAR and lead
optimization to produce a potent small molecule that inhibits
proliferation, mTOR signaling pathways, and total cellular PA levels at
low micromolar concentrations. The lead compound also inhibits
anchorage-independent growth of pancreatic cancer cell lines at nanomolar
concentrations. This compound demonstrates effects on cellular signaling
that are similar to the effects of LPAAT- siRNA.
