Title: TGF-1-induced EMT is suppressed by berberine in triple negative
breast cancers


Elevated TGF- secretion plays an important role in the development of
cancer such as tumor metastasis, invasion, and the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, TGF--responsive
gene signature is highly activated in chemotherapy-treated triple
negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we investigated the effect of
berberine (BBR) on TGF-1-induced EMT in TNBC cells. Our results showed
that TGF-1 significantly increased the level of mesenchymal markers such
as fibronectin, vimentin, and MMP-2 in Hs578T and BT549. To verify the
effect of BBR on these phenomenons, we treated with BBR and then BBR
decreased TGF-1-induced mesenchymal markers in Hs578T and BT549 cells.
Furthermore, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of TGF-1-induced
mesenchymal markers. TGF-1-induced mesenchymal markers were prevented by
a MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126 or a Smad3 inhibitor, SIS3, respectively.
Interestingly, BBR significantly decreased TGF-1-induced the
phosphorylation of ERK and Smad3 in Hs578T and BT549. Taken together, we
demonstrated that BBR may act as a blocker in TGF-1-induced EMT in TNBC.
