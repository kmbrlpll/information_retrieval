Title: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor is regulated by
E2F1-induced miR-19a in a feedback loop in glioma progression


The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is a nuclear
receptor, which belongs to the super-family of steroid hormone receptor.
To date, the biologic function of PPAR in human cancers is still
controversial and needs further investigation. In our study, we explored
the clinical feature, biological function and potential mechanism of PPAR
in glioma. PPAR expression was significant lower in high grade tissues
than low grade tissues in whole genome gene profiling of 158 glioma
tissues. PPAR activation using fenofibrate inhibited glioma cells
proliferation, invasion and aerobic glycolysis. Further, PPAR was a
direct target of miR-19a and miR-19a was modulated by E2F1 at
transcriptional level. Moreover, PPAR activation repressed E2F1
activation by modulating transcriptional complexes formed with E2F1 and
pRB proteins. Finally, we confirmed PPAR/E2F1/ miR-19a feedback loop in
vivo using nude mouse glioma xenograft and human glioma tissues. To our
knowledge, it is first time to demonstrate that PPAR regulates glioma
development by E2F1-induced miR-19a in a feedback loop and provide
important clues for understanding the key roles of PPAR functional
network in glioma.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.
