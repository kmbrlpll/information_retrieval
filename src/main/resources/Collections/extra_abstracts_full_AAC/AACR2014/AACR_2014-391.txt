Title: Identification of a novel tumor-suppressor gene through methylome
analysis in smoking-associated lung adenocarcinoma


Aberrant methylation of promoter DNA and transcriptional repression of
specific tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) play an important role in
carcinogenesis. In order to identify novel TSG candidates implicated in
smoking-associated lung adenocarcinoma (AC), we performed genome-wide
methylation profiling of six smoking-associated lung ACs with paired
non-cancerous tissues using the single-CpG resolution Infinium array.
After defining differentially methylated candidates including known
targets in ACs, we analyzed gene expression using microarray/RT-PCR to
identify genes potentially silenced by promoter methylation. Frequent
hypermethylation and downregulation of candidates was further validated
by pyrosequencing and RT-PCR/immunohistochemistry, respectively, in a
larger set of ACs, and methylation dependency of silencing was determined
by 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment and promoter assay in AC cell lines.
Through this approach, we identified one gene matching all of our
selection criteria for a possible TSG (HSLAC1, Lab. name). Additionally,
functional analyses supported a tumor-suppressive activity in vitro. Our
results implicate HSLAC1 as a novel TSG for smoking-associated lung AC.
