Title: Plasma membrane fluidity drives metastasis in breast cancer


New therapeutic targets that can inhibit cancer metastasis are
desperately needed. To address this issue, we have leveraged a
computational approach and performed an unbiased screen for therapies
that can inhibit an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene
expression profile, a phenotype that is believed to promote metastases.
This yielded predictions of drugs that can both promote and inhibit an
EMT transcriptional profile. Following up on these predictions, we
confirmed that these drugs can induce or repress an EMT in a range of
breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we discovered that they do so by
altering the fluidity of the plasma membrane. An increase in plasma
membrane fluidity is necessary and sufficient to induce and maintain an
EMT state, increased motility, and increased mammosphere forming ability.
Finally, we found that human cancers can regulate their membrane fluidity
through cholesterol homeostasis pathways. Human breast tumors with
altered cholesterol profiles have a significantly shorter time to
metastasis. These data demonstrate that plasma membrane fluidity is a
cellular attribute that is leveraged by human tumors to increase
metastatic capacity, and that it can, in principle, be targeted by
therapeutics to prevent metastasis.
