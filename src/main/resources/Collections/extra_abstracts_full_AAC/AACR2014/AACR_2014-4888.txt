Title: The novel cytokine IL-17D at the intersection of cellular stress
and tumor immunity


Our laboratory has recently identified a novel role for the cytokine
IL-17D as an important mediator of the antitumor immune response; and,
the loss of IL-17D as a key component of tumor progression. Our data show
for the first time that overexpression of the cytokine IL-17D is
sufficient to induce tumor rejection or growth delay. Tumors expressing
IL-17D displayed an increased infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells,
which gave way to a commensurate increase of M1-type macrophages. While
examining the regulation of IL-17D, we came across the surprising finding
that IL-17D can be induced by oxidative stress signals via the
transcription factor nrf2. Nrf2, responsible for regulating the
expression of the anti-oxidant response element genes, is known as the
primary cellular responder to oxidative stress. Although the role of nrf2
in cancer biology has been well studied, the role of nrf2 in the
regulation of immune responses (particularly via IL-17D) has yet to be
defined. We find that nrf2 is necessary to induce IL-17D expression in a
variety of tumor and non-tumor cells, and that this regulation is active
in tumor progression. These studies constitute an intriguing and novel
connection between oxidative cellular stress and immune activation.
