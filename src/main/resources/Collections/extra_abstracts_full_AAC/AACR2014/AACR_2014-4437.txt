Title: Fbxw8 targets hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 for proteasomal
degradation


HPK1, a member of mammalian Ste20-like serine/threonine kinases, is lost
in >95% pancreatic cancer through proteasomemediated degradation.
However, the mechanism of HPK1 loss has not been defined. The aims of
this study are to identify the ubiquitin ligase and to examine the
mechanisms that targets HPK1 degradation. We found that the CUL7
ubiquitin ligase targeted HPK1 for degradation via the 26S proteasome.
The ubiquitination of HPK1 required its kinase activity and
autophosphorylation. Wild-type protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), but not the
phosphatase-dead PP4 mutant, PP4-RL, inhibits the interaction of Fbxw8
with HPK1 and Fbxw8-mediated ubiquitination of HPK1.In addition, we
showed that Thr355 of HPK1 is a key PP4 dephosphorylation site, through
which Fbxw8 and PP4 regulates HPK1 stability. Our study demonstrated that
CUL7 ubiquitin ligase targets HPK1 for degradation which requires HPK1
kinase activity and autophosphorylation. Fbxw8-mediated HPK1 degradation
revealed a direct link and novel role of CUL7 ubiquitin ligase in the
MAPK pathway, which plays a critical role in cell proliferation and
differentiation.
