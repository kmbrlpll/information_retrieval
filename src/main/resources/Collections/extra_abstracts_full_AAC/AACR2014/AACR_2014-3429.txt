Title: Synthetic lethal RNAi screens to nominate potential therapeutic
combinations for uveal melanoma


Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common form of ocular cancer in adults
and metastatic disease currently has no effective therapy. Over 80% of UM
tumors harbor activating mutations in the heterotrimeric G protein
subunits GNAQ or GNA11. These mutations induce protein kinase C (PKC) and
the MAP kinase pathway, which signals through RAF, MEK, and ERK. Clinical
trials of MEK and PKC inhibitors are underway to treat UM, however, novel
therapeutic strategies may be required for effective treatment. To
identify rational combination therapies in the context of MEK or PKC
inhibition, we performed a pooled, genome-wide synthetic lethal RNA
interference screen. Candidate genes whose silencing sensitizes
GNAQ/11-mutant UM cells to MEK or PKC inhibition were nominated and
further validated across a panel of cell lines using a custom pool of
shRNAs. Several genes scored well across all cell lines. The top MEK
inhibitor sensitizer was BRAF, thereby highlighting the importance of
MAPK signaling in UM. Several non-MAPK pathway genes were also nominated
and may represent novel pathways for the development of combination
therapies.
