Title: Prevalence of high risk human papillomavirus infection in
different cervical cytological features among health examination of women
in National Cancer Institute, Thailand


High-risk (HR) human paillomavirus (HPV) testing is important in cervical
cancer screening for triage colposcopy. The objective of the study was to
evaluate the prevalence of HPV HR infection in different cytological
features among health examination women. DNA was extracted from 2896
residual liquid-based cytology specimens collected during routine
liquid-based Papanicolaou tests at National Cancer Institute. Overall,
HPV HR prevalence was 9.3% including 1.6% of HPV-16 and 0.4% of HPV-18.
HPV prevalent was highest in women younger than 35 years of age,
decreasing in women of older age. Among women with normal cytology, HPV
HR positive were found in 6.7%. In abnormal cytology, HPV HR were found
in 46.7% atypical squamous cells (ASC), 54.8% were low-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and 80.0% were high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). HPV-16 were detected in 8.6%, 6.5% and
12.0% of ASC, LSIL and HSIL, respectively.The results of this study
provide baseline information on the HPV type distribution, which may
useful for clinicians to decide who should be monitored or treated more
aggressively.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.
