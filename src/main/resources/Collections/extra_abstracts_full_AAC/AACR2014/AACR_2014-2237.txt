Title: Acquisition of biospecimens to support the Genotype-Tissue
Expression (GTEx) project


The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is an NIH Common Fund study
that is aimed at understanding how genetic variation influences gene
expression in normal tissues. Here we describe a biospecimen collection
platform that was developed to address the logistical challenges of
acquiring a large collection of high-quality tissues from rapid autopsy
and organ donors for GTEx. This complex infrastructure is utilized to
procure specimens under a rigorous quality management program and a
stringent ethical, legal, and regulatory framework. Ultimately, data from
the GTEx study will be used to evaluate gene regulatory mechanisms and
their contribution to human disease development.
