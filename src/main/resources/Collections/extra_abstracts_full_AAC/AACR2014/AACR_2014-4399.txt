Title: Somatic HIF2A mutations identified in a new syndrome with multiple
paragangliomas and somatostatinomas associated with polycythemia


Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) control the cellular response to hypoxia
and when dysregulated, contribute to tumorigenesis. We identified somatic
HIF2A mutations in patients with a new disease syndrome of multiple
paragangliomas and somatostatinomas associated with polycythemia. Five
different somatic mutations in HIF2A were identified. All of them have a
single amino acid substitution in the evolutionarily conserved
oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain resulting in disrupting the
HIF-2 hydroxylation by prolyl hydroxylase domain-2 containing protein
(PHD2). Changes of HIF-2 hydroxylation resulted in the stabilization of
HIF-2 and cellular psuedohypoxia, that trigger activation of
hypoxia-related genes expression and, dysregulate hematopoiesis leading
to tumorigenesis. These results show for the first time that the
intrinsic HIF mutations are present in tumors.
