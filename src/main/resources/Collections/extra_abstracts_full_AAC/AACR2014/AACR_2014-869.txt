Title: Evaluate breast cancer diagnostic antibody specificity by using
high density protein microarray technology


Detection sensitivity and target specificity are the two key features for
a good diagnostic monoclonal antibody. There are a number of
well-established technology platforms to quantitatively measure antibody
affinity. However, there is no complete technology solution to evaluate
antibody target specificity. Antibody cross-reactivity could lead to
false diagnostic reports. Currently, high density protein microarray
technology is the best technology platform available for antibody
specificity evaluation. Here we will showcase how we utilized protein
microarray technology to evaluate target specificity for a couple of
commonly used breast cancer IHC diagnostic antibodies. Our data suggested
that cross-reactivity is one of the reasons to create off-target staining
for breast cancer diagnostics. We will also show how we can utilize
OriGene protein microarray chip technology to develop UltraMABs, the
Ultra-specific monoclonal antibodies for anatomic pathology application.
