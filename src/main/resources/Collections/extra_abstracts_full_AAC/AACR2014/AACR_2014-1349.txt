Title: Chemosensitization of breast cancer cell lines by Ell3


Ell3 is a RNA polymerase II transcription elongation factor that is
enriched in testis. The C-terminal domain of Ell3 shows strong
similarities to that of Ell (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia gene),
which acts as a negative regulator of p53. Recent studies in our
laboratory showed that Ell3 induces the differentiation of mouse
embryonic stem cells by protecting differentiating cells from apoptosis
by the promotion of p53 degradation. In this study, we evaluated the
function of Ell3 in breast cancer cell lines. Contrary to our
expectation, ectopic expression of Ell3 in MCF7 induces CDDP (cisplatin)
susceptibility by enhancing p53 dependent apoptosis. CDDP treatments
leads to the accumulation of p53 protein in the Ell3 overexpressing MCF7.
We confirmed that Ell3 inhibits proteosomal degradation of p53 upon
cisplatin treatment in MCF7. Ell3 also confer chemosensitivity to MCF7 to
DNA damaging agent, camptothecin. The treatment of camptothecin to Ell3
overexpressing MCF7 results in the accumulation of cells at G2/M phase of
cell cycle by the increases of p53 protein. Consistent with these
results, Ell3 downregulates the expression of MDM2, which binds p53 and
marks it for degradation using the proteasome. The underlying mechanism
of Ell3 to regulate MDM2 expression is under investigation.
