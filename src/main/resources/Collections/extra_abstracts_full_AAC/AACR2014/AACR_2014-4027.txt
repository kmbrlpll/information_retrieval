Title: Traditional Chinese Medicine herbal mixture LQ prevents
cyclophosphamide-induced metastasis and toxicity


Cyclophosphamide (CTX) can enhance metastasis (Cancer Res. 66, 303-306,
2006; Cancer Res. 68, 516-520, 2008) and has toxic side effects such as
immune-suppression, weight loss, and hair loss. In the present study, the
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbal mixture LQ (J. Cell. Biochem.
114, 2131-2137, 2013) was tested to determine if it could enhance CTX
efficacy and reduce side effects. HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells,
labeled with GFP in the nucleus and RFP in the cytoplasm, were injected
into the epigastric cranialis vein of nude mice that were pre-treated
with CTX and LQ. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-RFP cells were injected into
the tail vein of mice that were pre-treated with CTX and LQ. Efficacy was
monitored with dynamic subcellular imaging of trafficking of cancer cells
in blood vessels (Cancer Res. 68, 516-520, 2008) and imaging metastasis
to the lung. LQ significantly reduced CTX-induced lung metastasis and
cancer-cell adhesion to the inner wall of blood vessels. LQ also reduced
kidney toxicity induced by CTX. Treatment with LQ induced hair growth
after CTX administration. This result demonstrates that LQ provides safe
and effective prevention of metastasis and toxicity in combination with
chemotherapeutic agents such as CTX.
