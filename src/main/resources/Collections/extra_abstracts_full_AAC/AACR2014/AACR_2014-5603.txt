Title: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a receptor for environmental
pollutants, promotes tumorigenesis via intestine-specific homeobox
expression in hepatocellular carcinoma


Environmental pollutants often cause diseases. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AHR), a major transcriptional factor in the xenobiotic response,
regulates cellular signaling and metabolism, thereby influencing disease
progression. The detailed regulatory mechanisms, however, remain unclear.
Here we demonstrate that AHR expression promotes tumorigenesis and is
associated with shorter survival time in HCC patients. These phenomena
appear to be mediated by activation of a target proto-oncogene,
intestine-specific homeobox (ISX), in vitro and in vivo. The strong
correlation of expression and cellular transcriptional regulation between
AHR and ISX (in tumor and hepatoma cells) underscore the significant role
of this duo in HCC tumorigenesis and prognosis. Our experiments with the
ablation of ISX expression in AHR-mutant mice and hepatoma cells further
support the essential roles of AHR and ISX in liver and tumor
development. These results advance the understanding of the cellular
function of AHR and of its downstream gene, ISX, in HCC progression. Our
data may help to develop a new therapeutic approach to HCC.
