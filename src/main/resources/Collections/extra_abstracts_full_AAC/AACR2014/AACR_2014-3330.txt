Title: HER2 overexpression induces membrane deformation that increases
cell motility


Approximately 20% of breast cancers (BC) are characterized by the gene
amplification and overexpression of HER2, a member of the ErbB/HER
receptor family. While targeted therapies against HER2 effectively delay
disease progression in this BC subtype, details of how overexpressed
HER2s drive these tumors to malignancy are still unclear. To better
understand this process, we investigated various cellular responses to
HER2 overexpression in individual live cells. We developed novel single
receptor diffusion analyses that determine the activation status of HER2
by diffusivity, to estimate average HER2 activity per single cell.
Surprisingly, we found HER2 overexpression induces membrane deformation,
which depends only on the HER2 density, but not the receptor activation
status. Moreover, this membrane deformation lowers the available surface
area for formation of focal adhesion sites, resulting in reduced cell
adhesion and increased cell motility. These findings suggest there are
signaling-independent roles of HER2 overexpression in disease progression
of HER2 positive BCs.
