Title: The antitumor effects of PI3K beta inhibitors in PTEN negative
prostate cancer are enhanced by inhibition of reactivated PI3K alpha
signaling


The PI3K pathway is dysregulated in many cancers via selective activation
of class 1 isoforms. In tumors with deficient PTEN function, signaling is
driven by PI3K beta. We show here that a selective inhibitor of PI3K beta
inhibits the AKT/mTOR pathway in tumors with defective PTEN function, but
is ineffective in those where the pathway is driven by receptor tyrosine
kinases. However, inhibition of PI3K signaling by PI3K beta inhibitors is
limited by relief of AKT/mTOR dependent feedback and reactivation of
IGF1R and other receptors. This results in activation of PI3K alpha and a
rebound of PI3K-AKT signaling. This rebound is suppressed and tumor cell
inhibition is enhanced with combined inhibition of PI3K alpha and beta.
Combined administration of isoform selective PI3K inhibitors may more
effectively inhibit the pathway than pan-PI3K inhibitors because of the
greater selectivity and decreased off-target toxicity of the former.In
PTEN deficient models of prostate cancer, triple therapy with PI3K alpha
and beta selective inhibitors combined with a potent androgen receptor
inhibitor suppresses the reciprocal feedback activation of both pathways
and results in marked (complete) eradication of tumors in vivo.
