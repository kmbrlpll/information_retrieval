Title: Mps1 is modified by sumoylation during the cell cycle


Mps1 is a dual specificity protein kinase with crucial roles in
regulating the spindle assembly checkpoint and chromosome microtubule
attachment. Molecular mechanisms that regulate Mps1 levels and its
activity during mitosis remain unclear. Given that sumoylation plays an
important role in mitotic progression, we investigated if Mps1 could be
modified by SUMO conjugation. Endogenous sumoylated Mps1 was detected by
nickel affinity pull-down from HeLa cells that constitutively expressed
His6-SUMO1 or His6-SUMO2. When HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid
construct expressing Myc-Mps1, along with plasmids expressing His-SUMO-1
and FLAG-UBC9, were analyzed sumoylated Mps1 was also detected in both
asynchronized and mitotic cell populations. Expression of wild-type
FLAG-SENP1 completely abrogated sumoylated Mps1 compared with cells
transfected with enzymatically defective FLAG-SENP1, confirming that Mps1
is modified by sumoylation. We also identified potential lysine residues
of Mps1 that were sumoylated by the mutagenesis approach. Our study
reveals that Mps1 is modified via sumoylation and that future experiments
will be centered on understanding the biological function of this
modification during the cell cycle.
