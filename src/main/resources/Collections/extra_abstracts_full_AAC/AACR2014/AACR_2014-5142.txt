Title: Probing the molecular mechanism of EZH2 in rhabdoid tumors


Proteins that regulate chromatin dynamics and post-translational
modifications of histones are crucial transcriptional regulators, and are
implicated in diverse cellular processes including proliferation,
differentiation and genome integrity control. The Polycomb repressive
complex 2 (PRC2) plays a key role in the maintenance of transcriptional
repression of genes necessary for normal embryonic development. Enhancer
of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of PRC2 and methylates
lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27).Overexpression and mutations of EZH2 have
been reported to promote tumorigenesis [1,2]. Malignant Rhabdoid Tumors
(MRTs) are highly aggressive tumors of soft tissues showing high
sensitivity to an EZH2 inhibitor [1,3,4].Treatment with a highly
selective and potent EZH2 inhibitor (EI1) leads to induction of p16
expression, sustained growth arrest and senescence in G401, a MRT cell
line model (Fig. 1) (3, 4). Taking advantage of the strong
anti-proliferative effect of EI1 in G401, we performed an shRNA screen to
identify molecular targets that will confer resistance to EI1-mediated
growth arrest. We hypothesized that such targets will provide novel
insight of EZH2 biology in rhabdoid cancers, and may be relevant to
potential mechanisms of resistance.
