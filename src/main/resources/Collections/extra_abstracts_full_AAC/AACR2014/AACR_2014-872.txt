Title: APE1/Ref-1 as a serological biomarker for the detection of bladder
cancer


Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease1/redox factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1) is a DNA
repair enzyme whose expression is increased in several forms of cancerous
cells. We investigated whether serum APE1/Ref-1 is elevated in patients
with bladder cancer. Tumor tissue and serum from patients with bladder
cancer who had not received chemotherapy or radiotherapy (n=51) and
non-tumor healthy controls (n=55) was used. In immunohistochemistry, and
immunoblot analysis, the APE1/Ref-1 protein level of bladder tissues was
increased in patients with bladder cancer. The serum APE1/Ref-1 levels
were significantly elevated in bladder cancer patients than in those of
non-tumor healthy controls and its levels were correlated with tumor
staging and grading. The ROC curve of APE1/Ref-1 showed an excellent area
under the ROC curve of 0.824. In this study, the optimal combination of
sensitivity and specificity were determined as 93% and 59% for a cut-off
value of serum APE1/Ref-1 of 2.83 ng/100 l, respectively. The serum
APE1/Ref-1 levels are increased in patients with bladder cancer with
recurrence. These data indicate serum APE1/Ref-1 may help to identify
patients with bladder cancer and it can be used as a serological marker
of bladder cancer.
