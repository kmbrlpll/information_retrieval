Title: EZH2 marks polyfunctional memory T cells and controls tumor
immunity


Polyfunctional T cells mediate potent anti-viral immunity. However, the
nature and molecular mechanisms controlling their functional signature
remain poorly understood. Here we report that polyfunctional T cells are
characterized by high proliferative capacity and apoptotic resistance.
Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) phenotypically marks them and
functionally controls their survival and expansion. Notch signaling
regulates effector T cell function. We show that EZH2 represses Numb and
Fbxw7, two Notch repressors, activates Notch signaling, and Notch
subsequently stimulates Bcl-2 expression and protects EZH2+ T cells from
apoptosis via trimethylating histone H3 on lysine 27. Moreover, EZH2
targets T cell cycling repressors and promotes their expansion. EZH2+CD8+
T cells mediate anti-tumor immunity and are associated with improved
long-term cancer survival. Together, the data reveal a novel role and
mechanism for EZH2 in controlling polyfunctional T cells. Thus,
manipulation of EZH2 signaling in T cells may have therapeutic potential
in treating cancer patients.
