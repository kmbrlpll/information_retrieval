Title: Profiling the effects of MEK inhibition on kinase phosphorylation
and protease secretion using antibody arrays


The frequent deregulation of ERK signaling in tumors has led to the
development of MEK inhibitors, which have proven to be clinically
relevant to malignancies harboring BRAF mutations. Since proliferation
and invasion are intertwined aspects of metastasis, antibody arrays were
used to measure the effect of multiple MEK inhibitors on 43 kinases and
34 proteases. Treatment of SK-BR-3 cells with MEK inhibitors resulted in
decreased ERK (T202/Y204) and STAT3 (S727) phosphorylation. Increased p38
phosphorylation was observed following treatment with multiple
inhibitors, but a decrease was observed in response to PD0325901. These
differential effects demonstrate the utility of arrays for parsing out
crosstalk between signaling pathways. To assess the effects of inhibitors
across multiple cancer cell lines, changes in ERK phosphorylation were
examined using ELISA. High ERK activation was observed in both RTK-driven
and RAF/RAS mutation-containing cells, but did not correlate with
sensitivity to MEK inhibition and was instead determined to be inhibitor
dependent. Protease profiles were also impacted by MEK inhibition, with
reduced MMP secretion detected by antibody arrays and ELISAs in inhibitor
treated cells.
