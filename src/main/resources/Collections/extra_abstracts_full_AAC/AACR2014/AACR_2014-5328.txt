Title: GIAB: Genome reference material development resources for clinical
sequencing


Reference materials play important roles in validating performance of
sequencing platforms and enabling regulations of clinical applications.
Genome-in-a-Bottle (GIAB) project is a collaboration between NIST, FDA,
NCBI, academic sequencing groups, sequencing technology developers, and
clinical laboratories to develop analytical-grade reference genome
materials and accompanying performance metrics for the development of
regulations and professional standards for clinical sequencing. NCBI is
serving as the Data Coordination Center (DCC) and repository for the raw
sequencing reads, mapped alignments, genotypes, and other details for
each sample on a dedicated FTP site
(ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/ftp). Here we describe the processes
of data generations and data submissions, and how the community can
access the data. We are also developing a genome browser for data
visualization. GIAB consortium plans to release data to the public on a
regular basis.
