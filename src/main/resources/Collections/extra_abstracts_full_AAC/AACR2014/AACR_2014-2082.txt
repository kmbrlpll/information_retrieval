Title: PHD3 regulates EMT and therapy response in lung cancer


The hypoxic microenvironment is a characteristic feature of solid tumors.
Hypoxia initiates a number of adaptive responses that collectively
promote a more aggressive tumor phenotype. One important process that is
activated by hypoxia is epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a
cellular program that induces cell detachment and increases the invasive
capacity of the cells. The prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins PHD1, 2 and
3 play a central role in adaption to hypoxia and act as oxygen sensors
that regulate the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) response. Here, we
identify PHD3 as a crucial regulator of central tumor hallmarks in lung
cancer. We show that PHD3 is regulated during EMT and that modulation of
PHD3 levels in lung carcinoma cells controls EMT, the tumorigenicity and
metastatic capacity of lung cancer cells in various animal tumor models.
Mechanistically we show that these functions of PHD3 are mediated through
a signaling cascade leading to increased SMAD activity. Moreover, we show
that these effects are mechanistically linked to the acquisition of
therapeutic resistance in lung cancer and may therefore serve to predict
therapy response. These findings highlight PHD3 as an important regulator
of lung cancer progression, which controls several cancer hallmarks
including growth, invasion, metastasis and therapy resistance.
