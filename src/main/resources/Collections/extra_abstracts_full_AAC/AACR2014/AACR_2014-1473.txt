Title: Indentification of microRNA signature and deregulation in breast,
lung and colon cancer through next generation sequencing and quantitative
reverse transcriptase PCR


Global alterations of microRNA expression have been described in a large
number of malignancies and microRNA signatures have been used as
classifier for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response in cancer.
In current study, we compared the global patterns of microRNA expression
in breast cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer patients with their normal
adjacent tissues through next generation sequencing (NGS). Differentially
expressed microRNAs such as let-7 family, miR34 family, miR21 and miR29
family, miR17, miR92a, miR205, miR145 as well as other signature
microRNAs were further validated through quantitative reverse
transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Since microRNAs do not function in
isolation, we also compared the expression level of possible targeted
mRNAs such as target s for Let-7 family, HMGA2 (high mobility group
AT-hook2) , RAS, KRAS; targets for miR-34, SNAIL(zinc finger protein) ,
Wnt1, SIRT1 and CDK6; targets for miR-21 , tropomyosin (TPM1), PDCD4 and
PTEN; targets for MiR29 family, MCL1, KLF4 through qRT-PCR.Note: This
abstract was not presented at the meeting.
