Title: Size-based isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in mouse
tumor models


We report here isolation and cultivation of circulating tumor cells
(CTCs) in five human epithelial cancers (lung, prostate, colon,
pancreatic and breast cancer) implanted in nude mice. All of the cancer
cells were labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) for detection.
CTCs were isolated with an antigen-independent size-based separation
device (MetaCell, Metacell s.r.o., Ostrava, Czech Republic). We were able
to capture on average more than 2 cells for each of above cancer types
whereby the tumor has been implanted atleast 2 weeks before blood
withdrawal. The number of CTC is dependent on the stage of tumor in
animals. There was a very high heterogeneity of the CTCs with regard to
cell size and cell phenotype including epithelial- and mesenchymal-like
type cells in vitro. The development of a facile in vitro isolation and
imaging technology for CTCs will enable deeper understanding of CTC
biology.
