Title: Polythymine oligonucleotides inhibit tumor growth through the
induction of IFN alpha


IFN is an immune-regulatory cytokine, used clinically for the treatment
of various cancers. Administration of recombinant IFN or IFN-inducing
agents in cancer patients induce the activation/expansion of NK cells and
tumor-specific CTL responses, leading to tumor regression. Here, we find
that the Polythymine (poly-T) oligonucleotides (ODN) induce the
production of IFN. Current results indicated the intratumoral injection
of poly-T ODN could slow the growth of tumors and enhance the tumor
specific CTLs. Our results shows a synthetic ODN containing Poly T motif
have anti-tumor effect through the enhancement of IFN production.
