Title: Discovery of pyridyl pyrrolopyridinones as potent and selective
CK1 inhibitors


The canonical Wnt pathway regulates the ability of -catenin to activate
specific target genes. Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway is believed
to drive the development and growth of many cancers; for example, APC
mutations were observed in >80% of the sporadic colorectal cancers. The
casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of serine/threonine protein kinases is
highly conserved. Multiple members of the CK1 family are shown to
regulate the Wnt pathway through interactions with various proteins. The
central role of CK1 in Wnt signal transduction makes it an attractive
target for the treatment of Wnt-pathway dependent cancers. We employed a
structure-based approach and identified a series of pyridyl
pyrrolopyridinones as potent and selective CK1 inhibitors. These
compounds exhibited good enzyme and cell potency, as well as selectivity
against other CK1 isoforms, and favorable rodent PK profiles. Oral dosing
of optimized lead compounds resulted in significant inhibition of LRP6
phosphorylation in a mouse tumor PD model.
