Title: Epigenetic silencing of ARRDC3 expression in basal-like breast
cancer cells


Arrestin domain-containing 3 (ARRDC3) is a tumor suppressor whose
expression is either lost or suppressed in basal-like breast cancer
(BLBC). However, the mechanism by which BLBC suppresses ARRDC3 expression
is not established. Here, we show that expression of ARRDC3 in BLBC cells
is suppressed at the transcriptional level. Suppression of ARRDC3
expression in BLBC cells involves epigenetic silencing as inhibitors of
class III histone deacetylases (HDACs) significantly restores ARRDC3
levels in BLBC cells. SIRT2, among class III HDACs, plays a major role in
epigenetic silencing of ARRDC3 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Acetylation levels of
the ARRDC3 promoter in BLBC cells is significantly lower than that of
other sub-types of BC cells. Chromatin immunopreciptitation analysis
established SIRT2 binding at ARRDC3 promoter in BLBC cells. Our studies
indicate that SIRT2 dependent epigenetic silencing of ARRDC3 is one of
the important events that may contribute to the aggressive nature of BLBC
cells.
