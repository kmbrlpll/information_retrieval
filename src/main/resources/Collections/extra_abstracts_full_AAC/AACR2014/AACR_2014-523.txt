Title: Detection of PIWI-piRNAS in the mitochondria of human normal and
cancer cells


Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that
regulate differentiation in primordial germ cells, found mainly in the
nucleus and cytoplasm. However, despite the essentiality of mitochondria
to intrinsic apoptosis and energy metabolism, the presence of piRNAs (and
their associated Piwi proteins) in this organelle remains largely
unknown.In this study, a public database comparison of mitochondrial
RNA-seq data from human normal (HEK293) and cancer (HeLa and 143B) cells
revealed the presence of 29 mature piRNA sequences, with 12 of those
piRNA sequences perfectly matching 7 tRNAs (Phe, Val, Leu, His, Ser, Glu,
and Thr), suggesting piRNAs and tRNAs derive from a common precursor
mitochondrial polycistronic transcript. Consistent with their known
interaction with piRNAs, further examination revealed the presence of
PIWI proteins in mitochondria. Moreover, the majority of the 29 piRNA
sequences overlapped multiple longer sequences (expressed sequence tags,
ESTs) that uniquely mapped to the mitochondrial genome. To our knowledge,
this is the first report of Piwi and piRNAs in the mitochondria of
mammalian normal and cancer cells.
