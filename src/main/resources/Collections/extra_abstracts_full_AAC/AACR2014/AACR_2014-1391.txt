Title: SOX2-p63 interaction and genomic co-localization in squamous cell
carcinomas


SOX2 is a transcription factor essential for pluripotent stem cells and
the development and maintenance of squamous epithelium. We previously
reported SOX2 to be an oncogene subject to highly recurrent genomic
amplification in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Here, we aim to further
characterize SOX2's function in SCC. We demonstrate that SOX2 binds to
distinct genomic loci in SCCs than in embryonic stem (ES) cells through
comparative ChIP-seq analysis. Through mass-spectrometric analysis
following tandem-affinity immunopurification in SCCs we identify SOX2
interacts with another master squamous transcription factor, p63, instead
of its partner in ES cells, OCT4. We find that genomic occupancy of SOX2
in SCC overlaps with that of p63 at a large number of loci and this
SOX2-p63 coordinate binding is absent in ES cells. We further demonstrate
that SOX2 and p63 jointly regulate gene expression, including the
oncogene ETV4, which we find essential for SOX2-amplified SCC cell
survival. Together, these findings demonstrate that SOX2's actions in SCC
differ substantially from its role in pluripotency. The identification of
novel SOX2-p63 interaction enables deeper characterization of SOX2's
function in SCC and normal squamous epithelial physiology.
