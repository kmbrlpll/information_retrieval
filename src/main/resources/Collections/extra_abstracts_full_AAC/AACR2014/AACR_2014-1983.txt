Title: Real-time imaging of exosomes dynamic of cross-talking and cell
trafficking in 3D Gelfoam histoculture


Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (30-100 nm) released by many types
of cells during normal physiological processes and are thought to play an
important role in cell-to-cell communication to promote tumor metastasis.
Exosomes contain diffusible factors, such as cytokines, growth factors
and extracellular matrix molecules and also mediate local and systemic
cell communication through the horizontal transfer of information, such
as mRNAs, microRNAs and proteins. However, the exosome dynamics and
trafficking between cancer cells and tumor stromal cells in a metastatic
niche are still unclear. In this study, in order to image the movement of
cancer cell-derived exosomes, we developed a confocal time lapse imaging
system to use green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged CD63, which is a
general marker of exosomes, expressed in breast cancer cells cultured on
3-dimentional Gelfoam histoculture. We demonstrated that 3D Gelfoam
culture enabled imaging of structural cell-to-cell contact between
neighboring cells and exosome behavior in real-time. This system makes it
possible to monitor real-time exosome dynamics and cross-talking between
cancer cells and other cells and to identify the mechanism of exosome
release and uptake such as in a metastatic niche.
