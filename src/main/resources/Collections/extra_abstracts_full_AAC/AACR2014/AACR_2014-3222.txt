Title: Structural evaluation of several antitumor Tencon variants


Tencons are engineered alternative scaffold proteins that combine the
affinity and specificity of antibodies with the biophysical features of
smaller molecules and hold high promise as biotherapeutic agents. We
present the crystal structures and antigen binding data of several
anti-Tumor Tencon variants. The structures of the variants show a switch
of the FG loop conformation from -helical at the tip to mostly -strands.
This conformational change prompts differential exposure of potential
binding residues and a finger-like shape for the FG region that may
facilitate its access to binding pockets on the target protein, thus
likely accounting for the observed differences in KD.
