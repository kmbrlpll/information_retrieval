Title: Reprogramming of EMT and stemness by human recombinant CCN5 in
triple negative breast cancer cells


Epithelial to Mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important and
coordinated series of events associated with tumor metastasis and
invasion. Recent studies from our group had shown the importance of CCN5/
WISP-2 in the suppression of breast and pancreatic cancer progression
through the regulation of the invasive phenotypes. In our study we have
observed that exposure of triple negative human breast cancer cells
(TNBC), MDA-MB-231 and HCC-70 to recombinant CCN5 (hrCCN5), resulted in a
dose-dependent inhibition of cell-proliferation through the induction of
apoptotic cell death. Anchorage-independent growth and colony forming
ability of MDA-MB-231 cells were also found to be drastically inhibited
in the presence of hrCCN5. Distinct up regulation of the epithelial
markers such as CD24, and cytokeratin19 and down regulation of the
mesenchymal markers such as Notch-1, vimentin, and CD44 were observed in
CCN5 treated TNBC cells. CCN5 treatment also resulted in the significant
reduction of stemness of these cells, as confirmed by mammosphere assay.
Collectively, the studies indicate CCN5 could be a re-programmer of EMT
and stemness and thus hrCCN5 can be considered as a potential therapeutic
agent for TNBC.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.
