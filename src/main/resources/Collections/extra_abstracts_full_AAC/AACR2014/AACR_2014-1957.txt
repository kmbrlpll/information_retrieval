Title: Slug regulates SOX9 stability in lung carcinoma and its
involvement in the regulation of cancer stem cells and lung metastasis


Most solid tumors including lung carcinoma are believed to contain cancer
stem cells (CSCs) that are responsible for tumor initiation, progression,
and metastasis. Understanding how CSCs are regulated at the molecular
level may lead to novel strategies for cancer therapy. We have identified
two proteins, Slug and SOX9, which determine the CSC state of human lung
cancer epithelial cells. Inhibition of either Slug or SOX9 sufficiently
blocks CSCs in human lung carcinoma cell lines, as determined by side
population and tumor sphere assays, and attenuates lung metastasis in
vivo in a xenograft mouse model. Coexpression of Slug and SOX9 is
detected in the majority of lung tissues with advanced stage carcinoma.
Here we found for the first time that Slug regulates SOX9 stability. Loss
of Slug results in SOX9 degradation through ubiquitin-proteasomal
pathway, and overexpression of Slug conversely prevents SOX9 degradation.
Together, our results provide a direct evidence for the control of CSCs
and tumor progression by Slug and SOX9, and unveil a novel role of Slug
in SOX9 stabilization. These findings provide a mechanistic insight to
the pathogenesis of metastasis in advanced lung carcinoma.
