Title: Salmonella typhimurium A1-R induces quiescent FUCCI-expressing
cancer cells to cycle and become chemosensitive


Quiescent cancer cells are resistant to cytotoxic agents which target
only proliferating cancer cells. Time-lapse imaging showed that
Salmonella typhimurium A1-R (A1-R) encircled and invaded quiescent cancer
cells in monolayer culture, thereby eliminating them. Moreover A1-R
infected and killed quiescent fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle
indicator (FUCCI)-expressing cancer cells in tumor spheres. In contrast,
cytotoxic agents did not kill quiescent cancer cells in tumor spheres.
A1-R infection of FUCCI-expressing subcutaneous tumors growing in nude
mice resulted in killing quiescent cancer cells resistant to cytotoxic
agents. Furthermore, the combination of A1-R and cisplatin reduced tumor
size compared with A1-R monotherapy or cisplatin alone. This study
demonstrates that A1-R can kill quiescent cancer cells and also sensitize
them to conventional chemotherapy. These results suggest a new
therapeutic paradigm potentially more effective than current therapeutics
which are ineffective against quiescent cancer cells.
