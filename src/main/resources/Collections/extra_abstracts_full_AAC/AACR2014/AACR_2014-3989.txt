Title: High throughput screening highlights NFkB signaling in Ewing
sarcoma


Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most frequent pediatric bone tumor and
still remains of poor prognosis especially for metastatic patients.
Genetically, ES is characterized by a chromosomal translocation between
EWSR1 and ETS family members (FLI1 in 85% of cases). This leads to the
expression of EWS-FLI1 chimeric oncogene transcription factor. Aiming at
identifying EWS-FLI1 regulated genes with potential therapeutic targets,
a genome wide method was developed to rank these potential hits by
combining Ewing sarcoma transcriptome and ChIPSeq data. Accordingly, 273
selected genes were further investigated using a siRNA approach for their
impact on cell cycle phases and apoptosis using high throughput imaging
methods. 133 of these genes displayed a phenotype and bioinformatics
tools were used to connect these genes. NFkB turned out to be a major hub
in this network and upstream activation pathways were further
investigated. Interleukin-1 pathway may account for this observed effect
and in vitro and in vivo experiments are currently on going to validate
this hypothesis. Interestingly, preliminary results indicate that both
tumor and tumor microenvironment are of prime importance for the
activation of this pathway.
