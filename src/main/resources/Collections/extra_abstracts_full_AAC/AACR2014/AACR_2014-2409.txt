Title: BCL10 regulates RNF8/RNF168-mediated ubiquitination in the DNA
damage response


Our genome is constantly attacked by a variety of endogenous and
environmental agents. Timely and properly cellular response to DNA damage
is essential for maintenance of genome stability and integrity, which
plays key roles in prevention of tumor initiation and development. B-cell
lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10), when translocated or mutated, contributes
to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas and other malignancies.
However, the mechanisms by which the resulting aberrant expression of
BCL10 leads to tumorigenesis are poorly understood. In this report, we
uncovered that, in response to DNA damage, BCL10 is recruited to the
damage sites and modified sequentially by phosphorylation and
ubiquitination. Modified BCL10 in turn facilitates to bring about
cascades of ubiquitination and recruitment of DNA damage response (DDR)
factors, promoting high-fidelity DNA repair. Furthermore, BCL10 is
over-expressed in breast tumors (376 cases of breast cancer vs. 62 cases
of normal breast, p=0.000). Taken together, our study reveals a novel
function of BCL10 in ubiquitination-driven DDR, contributing to the
maintenance of genome stability and integrity.Note: This abstract was not
