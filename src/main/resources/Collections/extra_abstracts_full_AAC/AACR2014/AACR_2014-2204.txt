Title: Joint analysis of three genome-wide association studies of
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Chinese populations reveals new
susceptibility loci


We conducted a joint (pooled) analysis of three genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in ethnic
Chinese (5,337 ESCC cases and 5,787 controls) with 9,654 ESCC cases and
10,058 controls for follow-up. In a logistic regression model adjusted
for age, sex, study, and two eigenvectors, two new loci achieved
genome-wide significance, marked by rs7447927 at 5q31.2 (per-allele odds
ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.82-0.88; P =
7.72x10-20) and rs1642764 at 17p13.1 (per-allele OR = 0.88, 95% CI =
0.85-0.91; P = 3.10x10-13). rs7447927 is a synonymous single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in TMEM173 and rs1642764 is an intronic SNP in ATP1B2,
near TP53. Furthermore, a locus in the HLA class II region at 6p21.32
(rs35597309) achieved genome-wide significance in the two populations at
highest risk for ESSC (per-allele OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.22-1.46; P =
1.99x10-10). Our joint analysis revealed new ESCC susceptibility loci
overall as well as a new locus unique to the ESCC high risk Taihang
Mountain region.
