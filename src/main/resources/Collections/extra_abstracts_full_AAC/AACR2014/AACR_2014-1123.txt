Title: Fucosylated TGF- receptors transduce a signal for
epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer cells


Background: Transforming growth factor- (TGF-) is a major inducer of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in different cell types.
TGF--mediated EMT is thought to contribute to tumor cell spread and
metastasis. Sialyl Lewis antigens synthesized by fucosyltransferase (FUT)
3 and FUT6 are highly expressed in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer (CRC) and are utilized as tumor markers for cancer detection and
evaluation of treatment efficacy. However, the role of FUT3 and FUT6 in
augmenting the malignant potential of CRC induced by TGF- is
unclear.Methods: CRC cell lines were transfected with siRNAs for FUT3/6
and were examined by cell proliferation, invasion, and migration assays.
The expression and phosphorylation status of TGF- downstream molecules
were analyzed by western blot. Fucosylation of TGF- receptor was examined
by lectin blot analysis.Results: Inhibition of FUT3/6 expression by
siRNAs suppressed the fucosylation of type I TGF- receptor and
phosphorylation of the downstream molecules, thereby inhibiting the
invasion and migration of CRC cells by EMT.
