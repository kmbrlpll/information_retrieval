Title: Neddylation of ribosomal protein S27-like and RPS27 regulates
survival of breast cancer cells


Neddylation plays a distinct role in stabilization of a subset of
ribosomal proteins. How ribosomal proteins are neddylated and whether
their neddylation plays any biological roles in cell growth and survival
remains elusive. Here we report that ribosomal protein S27-like (RPS27L)
and its family member RPS27 is subjected to neddylation by MDM2 E3
ubiquitin ligase, and deneddylation by NEDP1. Disrupting neddylation with
MLN4924, a newly discovered small molecule inhibitor of neddylation
pathway, destabilized RPS27L and RPS27. Moreover, silencing of RPS27L and
RPS27 sensitized breast cancer cells to MLN4924-induced apoptosis. Our
results suggest that neddylation stabilizes RPS27L and RPS27, and confers
the survival of breast cancer cells.
