Title: Adenylate kinase 4 promotes metabolic reprogramming and induces
EMT in lung cancer through ROS-dependent stabilization of HIF1-


The metabolic alterations that are essential for cancer progression
remain largely unknown. Previously, we have identified adenylate kinase 4
(AK4) as a marker for poor clinical outcome that promotes metastasis of
lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of AK4-induced phenotype
remains elusive. By microarray analysis, we found downstream targets of
HIF1- were differentially regulated upon AK4 overexpression in CL1-0 lung
cancer cells. Furthermore, AK4 overexpression induces glycolysis and
results in accelerated glucose consumption, ATP utilization and lactate
production. Overexpression of AK4 also increases the levels of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which exaggerates HIF1- protein expression under
hypoxia and concurrently induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) in a HIF1--dependent manner. IHC analysis showed an inverse
correlation between AK4 and E-cadherin and a positive correlation between
AK4 and nuclear HIF1- in lung cancer patients. Moreover, patients with
AK4 high/E-Cadherin low showed worse outcome compared to patients with
AK4 low/E-cadherin high. Our study indicates that enhanced expression of
AK4 is a critical factor to trigger aerobic glycolysis and induced
HIF1--mediated EMT in lung cancer.
