Title: Basal stem cells contribute to squamous cell carcinomas in the
oral cavity


The cells of origin of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) are
unknown. We used a cell lineage tracing approach (adult K14-CreERTAM;
ROSA 26 mice transiently treated with tamoxifen) to identify and track
normal epithelial stem cells (SCs) in mouse tongues by X-gal staining and
to determine if these cells become neoplastically transformed by
treatment with a carcinogen, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO). Here we
show that in normal tongue epithelia, X-gal(+) cells formed thin columns
throughout the entire epithelium 12 weeks after tamoxifen treatment,
indicating that the basal layer contains long lived SCs that produce
progeny by asymmetric division to maintain homeostasis. Carcinogen
treatment results in a 10 fold reduction in the total number of X-gal(+)
clonal cell populations and horizontal expansion of X-gal(+) clonal cell
columns, a pattern consistent with symmetric division of some SCs.
Finally, X-gal(+) SCs are present in papillomas and invasive OCSCCs, and
these long-lived X-gal(+) SCs are the cells of origin of these tumors.
Moreover, the resulting 4-NQO induced tumors are multi-clonal. These
findings provide insights into the identity of the initiating cells of
oral cancer.
