Title: In-depth gene expression profiling of seminomatous testicular germ
cell tumors


In depth Whole Transcriptome Analysis by RNA-Seq was used to compare the
expression profile of testicular germ cell tumors with the histology of
seminoma and normal testis. From this analysis we identified a large
number of genes that showed differential expression with statistically
high significance, (p2X FC). The list included genes related to stem cell
pleuripotency (NANOG, POU5F1), proliferation (KRAS, CCND2), a number of
non-coding RNAs (snoRNAs, miRNA precursors, XIST), and testicular cancer
related genes (LDHB, AKAP4). From this list we identified a subset of
genes for validation and further screening. We used the OpenArray RT-qPCR
platform to quantitatively screen up to 224 coding and non-coding genes
using samples from different testicular germ cell tumors (seminoma and
non-seminoma) and normal tissue. Results from these screening experiments
will be presented.For research use only. Not for diagnostic procedures.
