Title: Identification of FC101-interacting proteins by immunoprecipitation


Fusarochromanone (FC 101) is a small toxic metabolite produced by
Fusarium equiseti, a fungus found on decaying cereal plants and food
grains. FC101 has been shown to exhibit anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer
activity on various mammalian cells. Previous studies have revealed that
FC101 inhibits growth of 35 human cancer cells and reduces mouse tumor
size almost two-fold with increased caspase3 expression in FC101-treated
tumors. cDNA microarray analysis and RT-qPCR were used to identify
differentially expressed genes in human bladder cancer cell lines
(UM-UC14) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) exposed to
different concentrations of FC101. These genes encode proteins that
represent possible molecular targets of FC101. The objective of this
study is to identify proteins that interact with FC101 by
immunopercipitation using an FC101 antibody in UM-UC14 cells. We predict
FC101 molecular targets will be verified in future animal studies and
eventually FC101 may be used as a chemotherapeutic agent.
