Title: Targeting MCL1 in NPM1-mutant AML


MCL1 and BCL2 are pro-survival molecules which inhibit the apoptosis of
AML cells treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The nuclear chaperone NPM1
is the most frequently mutated gene in AML. Using siRNA, we established
that knockdown of NPM1 reduced expression of both MCL1 (P=0.034) and BCL2
(P=0.025) and increased p53 expression (P=0.03) in NPM1-mutant OCI-AML3
cells. These effects were not seen in cells expressing wildtype NPM1. The
differentiating agent ATRA also reduced expression of both MCL1 (P=0.005)
and BCL2 (P=0.0005). ATRA (3 days, 500 nM) reduced cell number by 50% in
OCI-AML3 cells through growth inhibition, inducing features of
differentiation and very little apoptosis. Whereas inhibition of BCL2
using up to 3 M ABT199 did not augment ATRA-mediated cell reduction in
OCI-AML3 cells, RNApolymerase II inhibitors, which preferentially target
proteins with a short half-life such as MCL1, and which induce apoptosis,
acted additively with ATRA to kill OCI-AML3 cells. Primary AML cells with
mutant NPM1 (n=38) expressed higher levels of MCL1 but not of BCL2 than
NPM1 wildtype samples (n=61). Primary AML cells frequently co-harbour
mutant NPM1 and mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3. As FLT3
mutation drives aberrant MCL1, we examined the effects of ATRA on MCL1 in
NPM1 mutant samples with and without a FLT3 mutation. ATRA (3 days, 500
nM) induced the downregulation (>20%) of MCL1 in 4/4 primary NPM1
mutant/FLT3 wildtype AML samples compared to 0/3 primary NPM1 mutant/FLT3
mutant AML samples. MCL1 was also downregulated by ATRA in 2/5 double
wildtype samples. BCL2 was downregulated by ATRA in 1/4 primary
NPMmutant/FLT3 wildtype AML samples, 2/3 primary NPM1 mutant/FLT3 mutant
AML samples and 2/5 double wildtype samples. In conclusion, we show that
MCL1 levels can be downregulated by mutant NPM1 inhibition and by ATRA in
NPM1mutant/FLT3wildtype AML cells. RNA polymerase II inhibitors are
clinically available and this work shows that ATRA can enhance their
cytotoxic activity.
