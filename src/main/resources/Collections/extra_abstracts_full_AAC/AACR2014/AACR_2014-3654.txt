Title: The role of structure-specific endonuclease MUS81 in the induction
of cytosolic DNA in tumor cells


Genomic DNA is constantly damaged by endogenous and exogenous agents. The
DNA damage response (DDR) is vital for recognizing DNA damage and
instigating DNA repair reactions to ensure genome stability. MUS81 is a
structure-specific endonuclease that is required for resolving stalled
replication forks at sites of DNA damage to initiate Homologous
Recombination repair. Our preliminary data suggests that the potentially
detrimental DNA structures cleaved by MUS81 accumulate in the cytosol of
many tumor cells. Furthermore, we found that DNA cleaved by MUS81 induces
type I interferon expression in a STING-dependent manner, and initiates
an innate immune response in vivo. Cytosolic DNA in tumor cells was also
abrogated upon inhibition of DNA damage sensors, ATM/ATR and PARP1. In
addition, genetic inhibition of Mus81 in different tumor cells lines
impaired expression of cytosolic DNA and type I interferon. In summary,
our data suggest that the structure-specific endonuclease MUS81 cleaves
damaged nuclear DNA leading to accumulation of genomic DNA in the cytosol
of tumor cells, activating immunosurveillance mechanisms.
