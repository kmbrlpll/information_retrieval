Title: ROCK1 inhibition promotes the self-renewal of a novel mouse
mammary cancer stem cell


The differentiation of stem-like tumor cells may contribute to the
cellular heterogeneity of breast cancers. We report the propagation of
highly enriched mouse mammary cancer stem cells that retain the potential
to differentiate both in vivo and in culture and their use to identify
chemical compounds that influence both self-renewal and differentiation.
We identify epithelial tumor initiating cells (ETICs) that express
lineage markers of both basal and luminal mammary cell lineages and
retain the potential, from even single cells, to generate heterogeneous
tumors similar to the tumor of origin. ETICs can progress through a Rho
associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) dependent,
epithelial to mesenchymal transition to generate mesenchymal tumor
initiating cells (MTICs) capable of initiating tumors of limited
heterogeneity. The propagation of ETICs may allow for the identification
of new therapeutic compounds that may inhibit or prevent progression of
some types of breast cancer.
