Title: TRAF4 is a key molecule for lung cancer through regulating AKT
ubiquitination and activation


TRAF4 is a member of TRAF family. Although TRAF4 was reported to be
overexpressed in cancer tissues, the role of TRAF4 in tumorigenesis
remains unclear. Here, we found TRAF4 is over expressed in lung cancer
cell lines as well as lung cancer tissues. Knockdown TRAF4 dramatically
attenuated lung cancer malignant phenotype including cell proliferation,
anchorage independent growth and tumor development in a xenograft mouse
model . To our surprised, it is that TRAF4, but not skp2 is required for
Akt activation through ubiquitination in lung cancer. Overall, our study
suggests that TRAF4 might be a potential molecular target for lung cancer
prevention and therapy.
