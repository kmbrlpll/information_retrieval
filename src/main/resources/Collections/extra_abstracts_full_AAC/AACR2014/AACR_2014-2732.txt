Title: Identification of a small molecule selectively kill mismatch
repair deficient tumors


Lynch Syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by defects in the DNA mismatch
repair (MMR) pathway, accounts for approximately 5% of all colon cancer
cases. Lynch Syndrome tumors have proven to be resistant to most
conventional chemotherapeutic agents, making surgery the best treatment
option available. Here we screened NIH small molecule library for their
ability to selectively kill cells with mutations in the MSH2 gene, and
identified a small molecule that could target MMR-deficient cancer cells.
This small molecule intercalates DNA, trigering a DNA damage response in
MSH2-proficeint cells. In MSH2-deficient cells, continued replication in
the presence of this small molecule leads to the formation of DNA
double-strand breaks and ultimately results in apoptosis in the G2/M
phase of the cell cycle. In addition, this small molecule is not
mutagenic. Our results suggest that this small molecule may offer an
improved treatment option for patients with tumors characterized
mutations in the MMR pathway.
