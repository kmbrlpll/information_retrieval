Title: Roles of miR-215 and regulatory mechanisms for its biogenesis in
response to hypoxia in glioblastoma stem cells


Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor
in adults, which is highly resistant to conventional therapies. In GBM,
glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are critical for the tumor progression and
resistance. The hypoxic tumor microenvironment has been reported to help
maintain GSCs. However, the mechanism regulating responses of GSCs to
hypoxia remains elusive. Abnormal microRNA processing is a contributing
factor in various types of cancer including GBM. Using small RNA deep
sequencing and Real-time PCR array, we found a group of miRNAs altered in
the expression levels under hypoxia in the CD133+ GSCs. Further through a
functional screen, we identified miR-215 as an important mediator for GSC
growth and tumor progression in response to hypoxia. In addition, we also
investigated the regulatory mechanisms for the biogenesis of the altered
miRNAs under hypoxia. Interestingly, we found that hypoxia could regulate
miRNA processing both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. These
findings suggest that de-regulated miRNA biogenesis may have significant
impacts on the activities of GSCs under hypoxia.
