Title: JMJD5 regulates PKM2 nuclear translocation and reprograms
HIF-1-mediated glucose metabolism


JMJD5, a JmjC-domain containing dioxygenase, is important for embryonic
development and cancer growth. Here, we show that JMJD5 is up-regulated
by hypoxia and is crucial for hypoxia-induced cell proliferation. JMJD5
interacts directly with PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2, to modulate metabolic
flux in cancer cells. The JMJD5-PKM2 interaction resides at the
intersubunit interface region of PKM2, which hinders PKM2 tetramerization
and blocks pyruvate kinase activity. This interaction also influences
translocation of PKM2 into the nucleus and promotes HIF-1-mediated
transactivation. JMJD5 knockdown inhibits the transcription of the
PKM2-HIF-1 target genes involved in glucose metabolism, resulting in a
reduction of glucose uptake and lactate secretion in cancer cells. JMJD5,
along with PKM2 and HIF-1 are all recruited to the HRE (hypoxia response
element) site in the LDHA and PKM2 loci, and mediates the recruitment of
the latter two proteins. Our data uncovers a new mechanism whereby PKM2
can be regulated by factor-binding induced homo/hetero-oligomeric
restructuring, paving the way to cell metabolic reprogram.
