Title: Minocycline regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 expression
through the induction of its degradation in ovarian cancer: in vitro and
in vivo studies


Experimental data suggest therapeutic advantage from selective disruption
of the hypoxia response in cancer. We recently found that minocycline
decreases tumor VEGF expression in ovarian tumor xenografts in mice and
herein report a companion laboratory study to test if this effect was the
result of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) inhibition. Human ovarian
carcinoma cell lines (OVCAR-3, SKOV-3 and A2780) were treated with
minocycline in normoxic and hypoxic conditions and also in the presence
of hypoxia-mimetic agent deferoxamine in vitro. Two different in vivo
experiments investigated miocycline effects after single dose (30 mg/kg,
4 or 24 h) or longer exposure in nude mice bearing OVCAR-3 xenografts.
Treatment with minocycline inhibited the accumulation of HIF-1alpha in a
concentration-dependent fashion in vitro. A similar effect of minocycline
was seen in vivo. Furthermore, the inhibtory effect of minocycline on
HIF-1alpha was found to be associated with a significant decrease in
HIF-1alpha half-life showing that minocycline enhances degradtion of
HIF-1alpha. These data warrents further evaluation of minocycline in the
treatment of ovarian cancer.
