Title: Bet bromodomain inhibitors affects replication & cell cycle
progression


Myc family of transcription factors contribute to pathogenesis in most
cancers and their expression projects a poor prognosis. Genetic and
pharmacological inhibition of Myc and several Myc targets leads to
apoptosis and tumor regression. Recently, inhibitors of BET Bromodomain
proteins (BETi) were shown to have anti-tumor properties and this has
been attributed to Myc down-regulation. In this study, we show that two
structurally distinct BETi affects replication and cell cycle progression
at low concentrations where the transcriptome remains largely unaltered.
At these concentrations, S-phase progression is hindered, as assessed by
thymidine incorporation and flow cytometry analyses. However, in a
cell-free system replication is not impaired suggesting that
BETi-mediated block of replication is linked to effects on chromatin.
Furthermore, at higher concentration of BET, S-phase entry of cells is
completely abrogated. Ectopic expression of Myc fails to rescue these
phenotypes, suggesting a novel function of BET bromodomain proteins in
replication and cell cycle regulation.
