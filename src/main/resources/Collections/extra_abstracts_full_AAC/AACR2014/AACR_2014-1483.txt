Title: Biological and clinical significance of miR-224 in colorectal
cancer


MicroRNAs (miRNAs) not only participate to cancer initiation and tumor
growth, but also play roles in tumor metastasis. The aims of this study
were to identify specific miRNAs involved in colorectal cancer (CRC)
metastasis, and study their biological functions. We initially assessed
by microarray global miRNA expression profile in primary CRC tissues from
patients with or without metastasis. The most differentially expressed
miRNAs were validated in a large set of CRC patient samples by real time
PCR (qRT-PCR). We identified 7 miRNAs that were significantly upregulated
in stage III-IV primary CRC compared with stage I-II cancer, among which
miR-224 expression increased consistently with tumor burden. We used
transwell-based cell motility analysis in CRC cell lines to test the
biological activities of studied miRNAs, and showed that miR-224 and
miR-141 promote CRC cell motility. By using qRT-PCR, western blot and
luciferase assay, we identified SMAD4 as a direct miR-224 target
mediating miR-224's effect on cell motility in CRC cells. We conclude
that MiR-224 is associated with CRC malignancy, and functions as a
metastasis activator by negative regulation of SMAD4.
