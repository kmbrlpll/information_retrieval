Title: CD146, a suppressor of breast cancer, is a novel target of
CD44-signaling


More than 80% of cancer related deaths are caused by cancer cell
metastasis, a crucial step in the onset of tumor development. Among the
molecules involved in promoting cancer metastasis is the cell adhesion
molecule CD44, whose role in promoting cancer cell motility and
metastasis is well known. Despite this knowledge, the molecular mechanism
through which CD44 promotes tumor development and cell metastasis is
still unclear. CD146 (MUC 18) is another member of the cell adhesion
molecule family, first identified in highly metastatic melanomas. The
absence of CD146 in normal melanocytes and its high expression in
melanomas suggests its tumor promoting actions. Despite the association
between CD146 expression and development of melanoma, the expression
patterns and the role of CD146 in normal and metastatic breast tissues
are still controversial. In this paper we provided evidence clarifying
some of these discrepancies by presenting CD146 as a negative downstream
target for CD44. Finally, this study demonstrates a new role of CD44 in
regulating neovascularization and in promoting cancer cell transmigration
of blood vessels via regulation of its downstream target CD146.
