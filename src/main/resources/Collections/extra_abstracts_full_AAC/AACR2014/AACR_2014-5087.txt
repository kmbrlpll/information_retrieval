Title: Peli 1 targets BubR1 for ubiquitinational degradation and induces
aneuploidy transformation


Disruption of the BubR1-mediated function negatively impacts mitotic
checkpoint control, increases chromosomal instability, and is associated
with infertility, life span and cancer. Therefore, BubR1 plays an
important role in preventing abnormal mitotic cells with chromosomal
aneuploidy from achieving neoplastic aneuploidy, however it remains
unclear how the signalling activates or inactivates the BubR1 function
during the neoplastic transformation. Here, we report that Peli 1, a new
family of signal-responsive E3 ubiquitin ligase, directly interacts with
BubR1. This interaction promotes the ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and
prevents the kinetochore association of BubR1. In addition, cells
expressing Peli 1 led to severe mitotic defects and displayed severe
chromosomal aneuploidy in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results
suggest that Peli 1 expression acts as a potent causative signalling
against chromosome integrity by mediating the ubiquitinational
degradation of BubR1, and thus contributes to the development of
neoplastic chromosome aneuploidy.
