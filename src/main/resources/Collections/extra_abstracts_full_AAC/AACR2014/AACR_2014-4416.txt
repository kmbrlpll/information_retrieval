Title: IKBKE is a key mediator of Ras activation of NF-B and Ras
oncogenic function


Accumulating evidence indicates that the NF-B transcription factor
pathway is important for oncogenic RAS to transform cells and to drive
tumorigenesis in animal models. IKBKE has been shown to activate NF-B
through both canonical and non-canonical pathways. Here we show that
activating mutations of Ras significantly induce IKBKE kinase activity
and that depletion of KRas results in decrease of IKBKE activity only in
KRAS mutant but wild-type cells. KRas-induced NF-B DNA-binding and
transcription activity was abrogated by knockdown of IKBKE. In addition,
we demonstrated significant decrease of lung tumor development in
Ikbke-/-;KRasLA1 mice when compared to Ikbke+/-;KRasLA1 and
Ikbke+/+;KRasLA1 animals. Furthermore, depletion of IKBKE selectively
reduces cell survival and tumor growth in K-Ras mutant non-small cell
lung cancer cells. These data identify IKBKE as a downstream effector of
Ras which mediates RAS activation of NF-B and Ras tumorigenic activity.
