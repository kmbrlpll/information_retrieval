Title: Targeted delivery of curcumin to improve therapeutic outcome in
breast cancer


Conventional chemotherapeutics offered to treat breast cancer (BrCa) are
not selectively targeted. Due to this fact, they are toxic to the normal
cells. It is imperative to identify new anti-cancer agents and/or methods
to selectively target BrCa cells without affecting normal cells. In this
regard, Curcumin, a plant polyphenol, has shown very promising results.
Despite the proven anti-tumor effects of curcumin, clinical use of this
compound is restricted due to its poor bioavailability. To surmount these
problems, we developed nanoparticles, loaded with curcumin, using a
planetary-balled milling (PBM) technique with particles tagged with
folate for selective targeting to BrCa cells, which express high affinity
folate receptors. Multispectral imaging, using an Amnis ImageStream
system, was used to measure the response of curcumin-loaded PBM
nanoparticles, and free curcumin on various BrCa cell lines.
Curcumin-loaded folic acid-coated PBM nanoparticles selectively targeted
and were taken-up by BrCa cells and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, our
results indicate that targeted delivery of curcumin using PBM
nanoparticles was 60 % more effective in killing BrCa cells at
concentrations lower than the IC50 of free curcumin.
