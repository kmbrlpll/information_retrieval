Title: RNA editing in rhoq promotes invasion potential in colorectal
cancer


RNA editing can increase RNA sequence variation without alteration of DNA
sequence. By comparing whole genome and transcriptome sequence data of a
rectal cancer, we have found a novel tumor specific RNA editing in RHOQ.
The A-to-I editing results in substitution of sparagine with serine at
residue 136. We observed higher level of the RHOQ RNA editing in tumor
compared with normal tissue in colorectal cancer. The degree of RNA
editing was associated with RhoQ activity in colorectal cancer cell
lines. RhoQ N136S amino acid substitution increased RhoQ activity, actin
cytoskeletal reorganization, and invasion potential. KRAS mutation
further increased the invasion potential of RhoQ N136S in vitro. Among
colorectal cancer patients, recurrence was more frequently observed in
patients with tumors having edited RHOQ and mutant KRAS. Collectively, we
show that RNA editing is another mechanism of sequence alteration
contributing to colorectal cancer progression.
