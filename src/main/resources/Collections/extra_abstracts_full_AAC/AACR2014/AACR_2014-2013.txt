Title: NEDD9 depletion leads to MMP14 inactivation by TIMP2 and prevents
invasion and metastasis


The scaffolding protein NEDD9 is an established pro-metastatic marker in
several cancers. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of NEDD9 driven
metastasis in cancers remain ill defined. Here, using a comprehensive
breast cancer (BCa) tissue microarray, we show that increased levels of
NEDD9 protein significantly correlated with the transition from carcinoma
in situ to invasive carcinoma. NEDD9 expression is crucial for the
mesenchymal invasion of cancer cells at the primary site but not at the
metastatic site. Depletion of NEDD9 is sufficient to suppress invasion,
leading to decrease in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and lung metastases
in xenograft models. Mechanistically, NEDD9 localizes to invasive
pseudopods and is required for local matrix degradation via regulation of
MMP14 trafficking. Depletion of NEDD9 impaired invasion of cancer cells
through inactivation of MMP14 by excess TIMP2 on the cell surface.
Re-expression of NEDD9 is sufficient to restore the activity of MMP14 and
the invasive properties of BCa cells. Collectively, these findings
uncover critical steps in invasion of BCa cells with potential strategy
to target metastasis through manipulation of NEDD9.
