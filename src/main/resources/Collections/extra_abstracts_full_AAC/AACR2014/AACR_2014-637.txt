Title: Chemotherapy enhances recombinant lipoimmunogen-based antitumor
immunity against cervical cancer


Although CTLs play a major role in eradicating cancer cells during
immunotherapy, the development of immune escape often limits the success
of such therapy. Therefore, the simultaneous induction of CTLs against
cancer and administration of chemotherapy would be feasible to overcome
the limitation. The recombinant lipoprotein consisting of inactive E7
(E7m) biologically linked to a bacterial lipid moiety (rlipo-E7m) induces
the maturation of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells through
toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), E7-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)
responses and inhibits tumor growth. The large tumor (> 10 mm diameter)
was regressed when treated with rlipo-E7m and TLR9 agonist
(oligodeoxynucleotide, CpG ODN). In addition, the combinations inhibit
local immunosuppressive cells number (MDSCs, TAM and Tregs) and increase
CTLs number in tumor infiltration. However, the tumor grew again at 50
days after tumor implantation. To improve the therapeutic effects of
rlipo-E7m/CpG, cisplatin or gemcitabine was combined to treat large
tumor. We found that the combinations increase the survival time of the
tumor-bearing mice. The promising approach may be applied to other tumor
antigen for other cancer immunotherapy.
