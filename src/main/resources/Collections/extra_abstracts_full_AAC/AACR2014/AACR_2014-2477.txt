Title: Max inactivation in small cell lung cancer disrupts the
MYC-SWI/SNF programs and is synthetic lethal with BRG1


Our knowledge of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) genetics is still very
limited, amplification of L-MYC, N-MYC and C-MYC being some of the well
established gene alterations. Here, we report our discovery of
tumor-specific inactivation of the MYC-associated factor X gene, MAX, in
SCLC. This is mutually exclusive with alterations at MYC and BRG1, the
latter coding for an ATPase of the SWI/SNF complex. We demonstrate that
BRG1 regulates the expression of MAX through direct recruitment to the
MAX promoter, and that depletion of BRG1 strongly hinders cell growth,
specifically in MAX-deficient cells, heralding a synthetic lethal
interaction. Furthermore, MAX requires BRG1 to activate neuroendocrine
transcriptional programs and to up-regulate MYC-targets, such as
glycolytic-related genes. Finally, we observed genetic inactivation of
the MAX dimerization protein, MGA, in lung cancers with wild type
components of the SWI/SNF or MYC pathways. Our results provide evidence
that an aberrant SWI/SNF-MYC network is essential for lung cancer
development.
