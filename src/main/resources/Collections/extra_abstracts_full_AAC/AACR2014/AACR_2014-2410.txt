Title: Crucial role of the non-BRCT automodification domain of PARP1 in
either DNA binding and PARP inhibitor-mediated cell toxicity


Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (PARPi)-mediated synthetic
lethality is an attractive new paradigm for cancer therapy. While it has
been recently proposed some of PARPi may cause DNA single strand break
(SSB)-PARP1 or -PARP2 complexes, leading to cell toxicity, the mode of
action of PARPi-mediated synthetic lethality is not well understood. We
analyzed DNA damage response to PARPi using an isogenic set of DT40
cells. Both PARP-1 ko mutants and PARP-1 ko mutants expressing DNA bindin
domain-defficient PARP1 showed markedly more resistance to olaparib than
parental DT40 cells, indicating that PARP1 binding to DNA strand break
through DNA binding domain is critical in olaparib-mediated cell
toxicity. While non-BRCT automodomain domain deletion mutant showed a
resistant phenotype, olaparib causes similar toxicity in BRCT domain
deletion mutant and parental DT40 cells. Furthermore, PARP1 localized in
chromatin binding fraction in BRCT1 deletion mutant, but not in non-BRCT
automodomain domain deletion mutant. These results indicate that non-BRCT
automodification domain plays crucial role for the formation of stable
DNA SSB-PARP1 complex and olaparib-mediated synthetic lethality.
