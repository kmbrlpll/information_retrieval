Title: TET1, which act as an tumor suppressor gene, is suppressed by DNA
hypermethylation in gastric cancer


5-hydromethylcytosine (5hmC) is a hydroxmethylated form of DNA cytosine
catalyzed by TET proteins. Recently, it was reported that aberrant
regulation of 5hmC is associated with many cancers such as breast cancer,
glioma, leukemia and melanoma. In this study, we examined the status of
5hmC and the role of TET1, which converts 5mC to 5hmC, in gastric cancer.
Dot blot and ELISA assay results revealed global loss of 5hmC level in
gastric cancer, and that decreased TET1 expression was associated with
decreased 5hmC levels. Importantly, in gastric cancer patients, TET1-low
group had advanced metastasis and poor survival compared with TET1-high
group. To understand the mechanisms of TET1 suppression in gastric
cancer, we performed pyrosequencing in 80 paired normal and tumors
samples from gastric cancer patients, and found that the promoter region
of TET1 was hypermethylated in tumors than adjacent normal tissues.
Treating AGS cells with 5-Aza-2deoxycytidine (Aza-dC) restored the
expression of TET1. Transient transfection of in vitro transcribed TET1
mRNA into AGS cells significantly reduced the growth of AGS cells. In
summary, our results showed that DNA methylation is responsible for the
suppression of TET1 which has a tumor suppressor role in gastric cancer
