Title: Withacnistin blocks binding of STAT3 and STAT5 to growth factor
and cytokine receptors and induces regression of breast tumors in vivo


The binding of STAT3 and STAT5 to growth factor and cytokine receptors
such as EGFR and the IL-6 receptor gp130 is critical to their activation
and ability to contribute to malignant transformation. Therefore,
interfering with these biochemical processes could lead to the discovery
of novel anti-cancer agents. In this manuscript, we show that the natural
product, Withacnistin (Wit) blocks EGF- and IL-6-stimulated binding of
STAT3 and STAT5 to EGFR and gp130. Furthermore, Wit inhibits EGF-, PDGF-,
IL-6-, IFN- and GM-CSF-stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3
and STAT5 but not of EGFR or PDGFR. The inhibition of P-STAT3 and P-STAT5
occurred very rapidly, within minutes of Wit treatment and growth factor
stimulation. Wit also inhibits STAT3 nuclear translocation, DNA binding,
promoter transcriptional activation, and it suppresses the expression
levels of STAT3 target genes such as Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Finally, Wit
induces apoptosis, inhibits anchorage-independent growth and invasion,
and causes breast tumor regression in an ErbB2-driven transgenic mouse
model. These data warrant further development of Wit as a novel
anti-cancer drug for targeting tumors that harbor hyperactivated STAT3
and STAT5.
