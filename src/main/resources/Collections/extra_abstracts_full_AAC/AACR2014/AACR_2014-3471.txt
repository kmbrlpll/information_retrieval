Title: Gene expression profiling of a single laser capture microdissected
(LCM) cell


Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) is a technique providing a rapid and
reliable method to procure purified cell populations, either as multiple
single cells or a group of cells, from a heterogenic tissue sample
allowing a targeted approach to genomic profiling. When analyzing gene
expression profiles from a group of cells, the average profile may not be
a true representation of the many different profiles that could exist
even in a pure cell population (e.g., in different states of growth,
differentiation, or activation). As a result, the transcriptional
variability of individual cells and any insight into the relationship
between specific genes in single cells are lost. To fully understand the
complexity of tissue and cellular heterogeneity, it is necessary to
measure molecular signatures at the single cell resolution. Here we
developed a workflow for gene expression profiling of a single LCM cell
that can also be applied to small number of LCM cells. The ArcturusXT LCM
system was used to harvest single cells from frozen human tumor tissue
sample which were then processed for quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) gene
expression analysis.
