Title: Multicellular tumor spheroid 3D models to decipher cancer cell
biology and to evaluate anticancer drugs


MultiCellular Tumor Spheroid (MCTS) mimic the organization of a tumor and
is considered as an invaluable model to study cancer cell biology and for
the preclinical development of new antiproliferative drugs.We will report
how engineering of MCTS in association with new technological
developments can be used to explore the regionalization and the effects
of novel drugs. We will demonstrate the potential of these 3D models to
study the kinetics aspects of the response on live spheroids expressing
fluorescent reporters and markers using light sheet microscopy (SPIM).We
will also report the development of innovative microdevices dedicated to
the study of the dynamics of MCTS formation and to the monitoring of
mechanosensing and tumor growth-induced mechanical stress. We will
present our latest advances on the characterization of these processes
and on the use of these assays for the identification of new original
targets and compounds.
