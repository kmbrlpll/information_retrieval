Title: Antibody therapy against granulin-epithelin precursor sensitizes
liver cancer to chemotherapy


The novel growth factor granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP, also named
progranulin, acrogranin, or PC-derived growth factor) has shown to be
upregulated in breast, ovary, prostate, liver and various human cancers.
Our group has shown that GEP associated with chemo-resistance, recurrence
and cancer stem cell properties in liver cancer [Gastroenterology 2011
and PLoS One 2011]. In the current study, we demonstrated that, both in
vivo and in vitro, liver cancer cells that survived after
chemotherapeutic agents demonstrated up-regulation of hepatic cancer stem
cell marker CD133/GEP/ABCB5, and enhanced cancer stem cell properties,
including colony formation and spheroid formation abilities. Importantly,
combination of GEP antibody therapy and chemotherapy reversed the
phenotypes induced by chemotherapy alone in the liver cancer cells and
also the chemo-resistant subpopulations. Notably, combination of GEP
antibody and cisplatin resulted in the eradication of all established
intrahepatic human xenografts. This preclinical study demonstrated that
combination treatment has the potential to be effective therapeutic
regimen for GEP positive cancers.
