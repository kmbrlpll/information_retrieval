Title: Exome sequencing reveals BRAF mutations in papillary
craniopharyngiomas


Craniopharyngiomas are epithelial tumors that typically arise in the
suprasellar region of the brain. Patients experience substantial clinical
sequelae both from extension of the tumors and from therapeutic
interventions which damage the optic chiasm, the pituitary stalk, and the
hypothalamic area. Using whole exome sequencing we identified mutations
in beta-catenin (CTNNB1) in nearly all adamantinomatous
craniopharyngiomas (11/12; 92%) and recurrent mutations in BRAF (V600E)
in all papillary craniopharyngiomas (3/3; 100%). Targeted genotyping
revealed BRAF V600E in 95% of papillary craniopharyngiomas (36 of 39
tumors) and CTNNB1 mutation in 96% of adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas
(51 of 53 tumors). The CTNNB1 and BRAF mutations were clonal in each
tumor subtype and no other recurrent mutations or genomic aberrations
were detected in either subtype. Adamantinomatous and papillary
craniopharyngiomas harbor mutations that are mutually exclusive and
clonal. These findings have important implications for the diagnosis and
treatment of these neoplasms.
