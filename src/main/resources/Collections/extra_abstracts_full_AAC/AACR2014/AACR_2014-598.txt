Title: Forkhead transcription factor FOXF1 is a novel p53 target gene and
regulates cancer cell migration and invasion


p53 is an established tumor suppressor that can activate the
transcription of multiple target genes. Recent evidence suggests that p53
may contribute to the regulation of cell invasion and migration. In this
study, we show that the forkhead box transcription factor FOXF1 is a
novel target of p53 because FOXF1 is upregulated by p53. We show that
FOXF1 is induced upon DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore,
we identified a response element located within the FOXF1 gene that is
responsive to wild-type p53, TAp73 as well as TAp63. The ectopic
expression of FOXF1 inhibited cancer cell invasion and migration, whereas
the inactivation of FOXF1 stimulated cell invasion and migration. We also
show that FOXF1 regulates the transcriptional activity of E-cadherin
(CDH1) by acting on its FOXF1 consensus binding site located upstream of
the E-cadherin gene. Collectively, our results show that FOXF1 is a p53
family target gene, and our data suggest that FOXF1 and p53 form a
portion of a regulatory transcriptional network that appears to play an
important role in cancer cell invasion and migration.
