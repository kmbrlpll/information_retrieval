Title: Direct anti-cancer effects of zoledronic acid on human cancer cell


Zoledronic Acid (ZA) is a potent nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates
(NBP) has been extensively used to limit bone turnover in a various
diseases including tumors. Recently, clinical trails of Zoledronic Acid
demonstrated direct anti-cancer effects as well as the known
skeletal-related events. We investigated the effect of 4 NBPs on human
tumor cells proliferation and found ZA is most potent for GBM cell,
breast cell and GBM patients' stem-cell-like cells. ZA also effectively
inhibited GBM tumor growth in mouse model. ZA stimulated strong autophagy
but not apoptotic signals in all tested cells. One intermediate product
of cholesterols synthesis pathway-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP)
rescued cell from the cytotoxicity of ZA. Knock-down RABGGTA, which
encoded a subunit of the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase proteins, induced
a similar effect as Zoledronic Acid in cancer cell lines. These data
suggested great potential for Zoledronic Acid against human cancer.Note:
