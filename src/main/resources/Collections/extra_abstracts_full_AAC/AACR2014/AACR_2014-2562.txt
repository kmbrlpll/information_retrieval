Title: Evaluate in vivo efficacy of anti-tumor immuno-therapeutics using
MixenoTM mouse models


The past few years have witnessed a renaissance in the field of cancer
immunotherapy, relating largely to the clinical advances associated with
the development of immunomodulatory agents, e.g. monoclonal antibodies
targeting the immune inhibitory pathways (CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1). Often,
the preclinical efficacy assessments are based on the evaluation of
surrogate anti-mouse target antibodies using mouse syngenic tumor models,
because of the need for T cell activation in an immune competent system.
However, this strategy is limited due to the fact that the immune systems
in human and mouse are different, and a surrogate molecule needs to be
tested in those syngenic models. Here we set out to validate mouse models
that harbor human immune cells by pre-engrafting the immuno-deficient
mice with human PBMC (the MixenoTM model), and use them for efficacy
evaluation of the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody. PD-L1 high-expression
human tumor cell lines are selected for these in vivo models. T cell
activation, infiltration and the cytokine production were analyzed to
illustrate the immune cell involvement. In conclusion, the MixenoTM
models are useful tools in immunotherapeutic antibody development, and
may greatly increase the clinical translatability of animal studies.
