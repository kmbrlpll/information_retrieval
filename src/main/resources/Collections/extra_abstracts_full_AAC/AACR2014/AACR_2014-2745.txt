Title: Pharmacological characterisation of cell active inhibitors of
Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG)


Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) is the only enzyme known to
catalyse hydrolysis of the O-glycosidic linkages of ADP-ribose polymers,
thereby reversing the effects of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. Total PARG
deficiency leads to cell death whilst PARG depletion, using RNAi, leads
to pleiotropic effects such as PAR chain persistence, progression of
single- to double-strand DNA lesions and NAD+ depletion.Whilst efforts to
develop small molecule inhibitors of PARG activity have generally been
hampered by poor physiochemical properties, off-target pharmacology and a
lack of cell permeability, we have now developed a series of PARG
inhibitors which have proved to be useful biological tool
compounds.Displaying selective activity in both biochemical and, more
importantly, cellular assays of PARG function, these derivatives have
allowed an exploration of the phenotypes resulting from reversible,
pharmacological PARG inhibition.
