Title: Identification of novel methylation-silenced genes in oral
squamous cell carcinomas


To identify novel methylation-silenced genes in oral squamous cell
carcinomas (OSCCs), we took a combined approach of methylated DNA
immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-CpG island (CGI) microarray analysis and
expression microarray analysis after treatment with a demethylating
agent. MeDIP-CGI microarray revealed that promoter CGIs of 324 genes were
methylated in two OSCC cell lines (Ca9-22, HSC-2). By treatment of the
cell lines with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, 125 of the 324 genes were
up-regulated in at least one of the two cell lines. For 23 of the 125
genes that have not been focused on in the field of oral malignancy, we
analyzed their promoter methylation statuses in 16 normal oral tissues,
five OSCC cell lines, 26 OSCC tissues and 24 oral leukoplakia tissues.
Ten promoter CGIs were methylated not only in OSCC cell lines but also
OSCC tissues. The methylation profile indicated the presence of the CpG
island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in OSCC tissues. Furthermore, the CIMP
was observed in three of the 13 oral dysplastic leukoplakia tissues. The
CIMP was considered as one of early molecular events in malignant
transformation from oral premalignant lesions to OSCCs.
