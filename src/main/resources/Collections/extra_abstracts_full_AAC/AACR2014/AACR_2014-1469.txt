Title: Functional roles of SCAL1 expression in lung cancer and progression


Our group has identified a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), SCAL1
(smoke and cancer-associated lncRNA 1), whose expression is associated
with smoking and related to cancer malignancy (Thai et al., 2013,
AJRCMB). Currently, we have found that SCAL1 expression is necessary in
lung epithelial cells during injury in order to initiate repair after
exposure to smoke. In lung cancer cells, SCAL1 expression is needed for
cancer cells to combat DNA double stranded breaks associated with
chemotherapy treatment, especially cisplatin, doxyrubcin, and possibly
other DNA damaging reagents. Most interestingly, the induction of SCAL1
expression is regulated by NRF-2. While NRF2 may protect normal cells
from injury, it becomes persistently activated in some cancers and may
enhance their malignant characteristics. Therefore, SCAL1 expression is
an early marker for lung cellular injury and may be involved in lung
cancer progression. We believe that smoke-induced SCAL1 expression leads
to epithelial repair and enhances cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy.
Our hypothesis is that SCAL1 expression in lung cancer is associated with
increased malignant potential and is a poor prognostic marker.
