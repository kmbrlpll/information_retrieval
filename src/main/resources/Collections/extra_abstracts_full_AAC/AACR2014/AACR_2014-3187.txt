Title: Genomic abnormalities in air pollution-related lung cancer


The lung cancer incidence in Xuanwei (XW) City and Fuyuan (FY) County in
Yunnan Province of China is among the highest in China, owing to high
levels of air pollution produced by combustion of smoky coal. This
epidemiology profile provides a unique opportunity for identifying the
carcinogenic mechanism underlying air pollution. Here, we analyze the
genome sequences of 14 XW/FY non-small-cell lung cancers and their paired
normal tissues, and report a mean of 289 somatic exonic mutations and 71
genomic rearrangements/tumor. Among the recurring mutated genes, calcium
signaling and ion channel genes are the most frequently altered gene
category. Higher mutation rate in calcium signaling genes is confirmed by
genomic resequencing in 65 XW/FY patients and 85 patients from control
regions. Small interfering RNA mediated silencing shows that inactivation
of calcium channel leads to inhibition of lung cancer cells, suggesting a
role for calcium signaling molecules in air pollution-related
carcinogenesis leading to lung cancer.
