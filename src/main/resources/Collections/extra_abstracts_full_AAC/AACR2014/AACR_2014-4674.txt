Title: Finding cancer biomarkers in platelets


Introduction: In the development of personalized medicine we need a
window in to the tumor; it should be minimal invasive, being able to find
the disease and follow how the tumor alters its behaviour to circumvent
the treatment. Platelets could be one such window, with its ability to
sequester tumor-derived material during its passage through the
circulation. Material & Methods: With conventional quantitative PCR and
microarray techniques potential biomarkers were analysed from WTA (whole
transcriptome amplified) platelet-derived RNA isolated from cancer
patients and healthy controls. Results: We demonstrate that platelets
contain several cancer-associated RNA biomarkers. In addition, there was
a distinct biomarker signature in platelets from cancer patients of
different grades as compared to normal control subjects. Conclusion:
These findings are preliminary, and need to be validated in a larger
patient cohort. However, they support our earlier findings in gliomas
that platelets may carry the needle from the haystack that will give us a
window into the cancer biology of individual patients.
