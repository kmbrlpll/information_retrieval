Title: Insights into the invasiveness of triple-negative breast cancer
from genome-wide profiling of AP-1


Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive clinical phenotype,
and accounts for 15% to 20% of all breast cancers. The molecular
determinants of malignant cell behaviors in TNBC remain largely unknown.
We show that the AP-1 transcription factor component Fra-1 is
overexpressed in basal-like breast tumors, often referred to as TNBCs,
and that its expression level has high prognostic significance. Depletion
of Fra-1 or its heterodimeric partner c-Jun inhibits the proliferative
and invasive phenotypes of TNBC cells in vitro. Furthermore, knockdown of
Fra-1 or c-Jun also reduces cellular invasion in vivo in a zebrafish
xenograft model. Exploring the AP-1 cistrome and the AP-1-regulated
transcriptome, we provide insights into the transcriptional regulatory
networks of AP-1 in TNBC cells. We identify direct targets of the
Fra-1/c-Jun heterodimer involved in cell proliferation, cell adhesion,
and cell-cell contact. Importantly, we show that AP-1 represses
E-cadherin expression by transcriptional upregulation of ZEB2, thereby
stimulating cell invasion. This work sheds light on mechanisms and
pathways by which TNBCs acquire invasiveness and proliferative
propensity.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.
