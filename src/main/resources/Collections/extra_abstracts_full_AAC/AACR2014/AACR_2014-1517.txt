Title: Detection of SMAD4, MAP2K4, RB1 and CDKN2A gene deletions in human
tumor cells by multiplex qPCR


Gene duplications and deletions are critical to understanding cancer
biology. Deletion in SMAD4, MAP2K4, RB1 and CDKN2A genes are known to
play important roles in certain types of cancer or cancer states.
Characterization of such mutations in different tumor cells provide
insight into the study of novel biomarkers of cancer susceptibility,
initiation, progression and metastases and help identify them as risk
factors for various types of cancer. We demonstrated a quantitative
method to detect multiple gene deletions in human tumor cells by
multiplex PCR. We designed four TaqMan Copy Number Assays to interrogate
common deletion mutations in SMAD4, MAP2K4, RB1 and CDKN2A genes and
performed multiplex PCR alongside with endogenous controls on
representative human tumor and normal cells in different tissues. Since
the detection of multiple deletion targets were performed in one single
reaction, we were able to profile multiple deletion mutations in one
single sample. This method can potentially be applied to the study of
Copy Number Variations (CNV) on biological samples with limited quantity
such as FFPE samples, as well as enables the characterization of multiple
targets on samples in exactly the same condition and state.
