Title: SMYD2-dependent PARP1 methylation promotes Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation
activity in cancer cells


Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) catalyzes the
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of protein acceptors using NAD+ as the substrate
is now considered as an important target for development of anticancer
therapy. PARP1 is known to be posttranslationally modified in various
ways including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, but the physiological
role of PARP1 methylation is not well understood. Here we demonstrated
that the histone methyltransferase SMYD2 (SET and MYND domain containing
2), which plays critical roles in human carcinogenesis, mono-methylated
PARP1. We found lysine 528 to be a target of SMYD2-dependent PARP1
methylationa and that an N-Terminal DNA binding domain of PARP1 interact
with an N-terminal domain of SMYD2. Importantly, methylated PARP1
revealed enhanced poly(ADP-ribose) formation after oxidative stress, and
positively regulated the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity of PARP1. Hence,
our study unveils a novel mechanism of PARP1 in human cancer through its
methylation by SMYD2.
