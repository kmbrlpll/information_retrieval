Title: 3 integrin/KRAS/RalB complex drives tumor stemness and resistance
to EGFR inhibition


Integrin v3 expression is a marker of tumor progression for a wide range
of histologically distinct cancers, yet the molecular mechanism by which
v3 influences the growth and malignancy of cancer is poorly understood.
Here, we reveal that integrin v3, in the unligated state on lung, breast
and pancreatic cancer cells, recruits KRAS and RalB to the plasma
membrane, leading to the activation of TBK-1/c-Rel. These events are both
necessary and sufficient to promote tumor initiation,
anchorage-independence, self-renewal, as well as resistance to nutrient
deprivation and treatment with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors
such as erlotinib. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of RalB or its
effectors suppress tumor initiation, self-renewal, and re-sensitizes
tumors to RTK inhibition. These findings not only identify 3 as a
marker/driver of tumor stemness but also provide a strategy to overcome
tumor resistance to RTK Inhibition.
