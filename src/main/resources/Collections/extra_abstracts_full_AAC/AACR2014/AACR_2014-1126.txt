Title: Tristetraprolin inhibits Twist1-induced cancer cell migration


Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) enhances tumor cell migration.
However, detail mechanisms for the regulation of EMT are not well known.
Tristetraprolin (TTP) is an AU-rich element (ARE) binding protein that
can promote the decay of the transcripts. This study demonstrates that
TTP plays a critical role in EMT process. Overexpression of TTP in
ovarian cancer cells decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers
(N-cadherin and Vimentin), increased the expression of epithelial marker
(E-cadherin), and inhibited cell migration and invasion activities. On
the contrary, inhibition of TTP by siRNA decreased the expression of
E-cadherin, increased the expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin, and
promoted cell migration and invasion. The cDNA microarray analysis
revealed that Twist1 was significantly down-regulated in
TTP-overexpressed cells. Twist1 mRNA contains ARE within its 3-UTR and
TTP enhances the decay of Twist1 mRNA through binding to its 3-UTR. In
addition, TTP directly bound to the ARE of Twist1 mRNA by EMSA assay.
Ectopic expression of Twist1 gene without 3UTR blocked the inhibitory of
TTP on the EMT. We also observed enhanced levels of Twist1 and reduced
TTP levels in human ovarian adenocarcinoma. Collectively, our data
indicate that TTP conducts anti-metastatic activity by down-regulating
Twist1, presenting a novel mechanism of TTP-mediated regulation of tumor
metastasis.
