Title: Color-coded imaging of vessel anastomosis in vivo using RFP and
CFP transgenic mice


We previously report the development of a color-coded imaging model that
can visualize the anastomosis between blood vessels of red fluorescent
protein (RFP)-expressing vessels in Gelfoam previously vascularized in
RFP transgenic mice and blood vessels of nestin-driven green fluorescent
protein (ND-GFP) mice that express GFP in nascent vessels (Anticancer
Res. 33: 3041-3046, 2013). In the present study, fourteen days after
transplantation into RFP transgenic nude mice, the Gelfoam was removed
and re-transplanted into the subcutis on the flank of cyan fluorescent
protein (CFP) transgenic mice. Skin flaps were made and anastomosis
between the CFP-expressing vessels and RFP blood vessels in the Gelfoam
was imaged 14 and 21 days after re-transplantation. The results presented
in this and our previous report suggest a new paradigm of visualizing
blood vessel anastomosis and its implications for tumor angiogenesis.
