Title: Radiation treatment solubilizes membrane receptors in meningioma
cells


In our earlier studies we reported that radio-resistance was associated
with soluble uPAR and uPARAP in meningioma cells. In the present study we
show solubilization of a broad range of membrane-bound receptors induced
by radiation treatment. Although the increase in radiation dosage beyond
10Gy increased the release of receptors, cell proliferation was adversely
affected. Further, fractionated dosages (5Gy+5Gy) or a single dose (10Gy)
radiation showed a significant surge in soluble receptors after 36 hours
of treatment. Correspondingly, an initial lag in proliferation with G2-M
arrest and subsequent recovery was seen in irradiated cells. Pretreatment
of meningioma cells with N-acetyl cysteine before radiation treatment
significantly quenched the solubilization of receptors. Conditioned media
collected from irradiated cells promoted invasiveness and migration of
meningioma cells compared to the controls. Later, screening for cell-free
receptors in the brain sections of tumor-bearing mice also showed an
increased incidence in irradiated groups. In conclusion, our study
reveals an additional niche of receptor functioning in meningioma.
