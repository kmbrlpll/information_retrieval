Title: YAP nuclear accumulation involved in drug-induced cellular
senescence in vitro


Cellular senescence is accompanied by some striking morphological
changes, such as becoming large, flat and multinucleated. However, how
these changes are established is poorly understood. The Hippo pathway
plays an important role in the control of organ size. Previous study
reported that YAP, one major downstream effector of Hippo pathway, could
be regulated by mechanical signals through F-actin bundles. However,
whether YAP participates in the control of cell size through cytoskeleton
remains unexplained. In our current study, we found that the senescent
cells induced with adriamycin or camptothecin became large and flat, and
the stress fibers of the senescent cells seemed to maintain or increase,
observed by F-actin staining, though in a way of inappropriate actin
clumping. Moreover increased nuclear level and activity of YAP were
identified in drug-induced senescent cells. Hence, our data indicated
that the increased F-actin bundles and mechanical signals could be
acquired in senescent cells induced by adriamycin or camptothecin. In
summary, based on our findings here, we proposed that YAP might play some
roles during drug-induced cellular senescence in vitro.
