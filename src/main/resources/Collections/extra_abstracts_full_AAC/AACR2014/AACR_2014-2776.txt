Title: Overexpression of HGF is an effective indicator for Met-targeting
therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma


The success of molecular targeted therapy against cancer depends on
discovering the essential pathways that contribute to carcinogenesis and
cancer progression and the molecular targets that control the pathway
activity. By using genetically engineered mouse models, we show that
overexpression of Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulated HBV surface
antigen (HBsAg) production and accelerated the HCC progression. HGF
transgenic mouse model produced spontaneous HCC with genomic profiles
similar to that HBV-positive HCC patients with poor prognosis.
Mechanistically, MET receptor expression is required for repair of
virus-induced liver damage and HCC development. Importantly, HGF
overexpression induces an autocrine activation which determines the
sensitivity to small-molecule Met inhibitors. MET inhibitors are entering
clinical trials against cancer, and our data provide a molecular basis
for targeting the Met pathway in hepatitis B-induced HCC. Our results
demonstrate that HGF is a driver of HBV-induced HCC progression and may
serve as an effective biomarker for Met-targeted therapy, and that
hgf-transgenic mouse model serves as a good tool for studying human HCC
biology and preclinical evaluating therapeutics.
