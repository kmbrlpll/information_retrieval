Title: Drug resistance via feedback activation of Stat3 in
oncogene-addicted cancer cells


Targeted therapy directed against oncogene-addicted cancers can produce
dramatic responses that are invariably of limited durability due to the
emergence of subpopulations of drug-resistant cells. We found that many
oncogene-addicted cancer cells treated with pathway-targeted drugs engage
a positive feedback loop leading to activation of Stat3, which promotes
cell survival, consequently limiting the overall drug response. This was
observed in cancer cells driven by diverse mutationally-activated
kinases, including EGFR, HER2, ALK, and MET, as well as mutant KRAS. We
determined that inhibition of MEK signaling specifically promotes Stat3
engagement. MEK inhibition led to the autocrine-driven activation of
Stat3 via the FGF receptor and JAK family kinases, and pharmacological
inhibition of MEK together with JAK and FGFR effectively promoted tumor
regression in vivo. These findings suggest that inhibition of a Stat3
feedback loop may enhance the response to a broad spectrum of drugs that
target pathways of oncogene addiction.
