Title: A novel imidazole derivate inhibits STAT3 activation via induction
of SHP-1 hepatocellular carcinoma


The activation of STAT3 signaling cascade has been linked with cell
survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis in HCC. Literature have shown
that overexpression of SHP-1 suppressed cell proliferation in varies
cancer cells. Compounds that can activate SHP-1 and further repress STAT3
activity pathway have potential for treatment of HCC. We investigated
whether imidazole derivates can modulate the SHP-1/STAT3 pathway. The
result showed that imidazole derivate inhibited both constitutive and
interleukin 6-inducible STAT3 phosphorylation in HCC cells and induced
cell apoptosis. In addition, we explored protein tyrosine phosphatases
(SHP-1 and SHP-2) expression level in HCC cells with the treatment of the
imidazole derivate. Interestingly, the imidazole derivate significantly
induced the expression of SHP1 and subsequently inhibited the
phosphorylation of Src , Jak2 and STAT3. This agent also repressed the
expression of STAT3-regulated target genes, including cyclin D1, Mcl-1,
and survivin. Overall, our results suggest that the imidazole derivate
blocks STAT3 activation through up-regulation of SHP-1, and this may have
potential for combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.
