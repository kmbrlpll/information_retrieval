Title: Evaluation of the aromatase inhibition potential of standardized
grape extract


OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of grape extract as a potential
aromatase inhibitor by testing of plasma hormone levels.PROCEDURE: A
six-week study was conducted involving postmenopausal women during which
94 grams of grape extract was consumed in addition to their usual diet.
Plasma hormones were measured before and after treatment.RESULTS: Of the
18 women involved in the study, average age and BMI were 61.4 years and
24.4, respectively. For the hormone levels studied, the following median
(IQR) percent change from baseline to 6 weeks values were found:
estradiol +11.8% (-34.4%,+44.2%), p = 0.42; estrone +3.4%
(-15.7%,+12.9%), p = 0.64; estrone sulfate +5.3% (-19.9%,+56.3%), p =
0.35; testosterone -1.5% (-14.7%,+10.7%), p = 0.97; androstenedione
+12.6% (-17.1%, +49.1%), p = 0.15. The hormone levels did not
significantly change between baseline and six weeks. Further, the changes
that were observed did not tend to go in the hypothesized direction
(estrogens and conjugates increased slightly, testosterone decreased
slightly). Only androstenedione showed a trend toward change in the
hypothesized direction.CONCLUSION: In this study, there was no evidence
that plasma hormone levels are altered by 6 weeks of daily consumption of
94 grams of grape extract powder.
