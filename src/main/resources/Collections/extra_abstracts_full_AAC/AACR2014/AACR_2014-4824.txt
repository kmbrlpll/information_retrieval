Title: Evaluation of CTCs enriched with a flexible microspring array
device as a prognostic biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma


The dissemination of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) implicated in the
metastatic spread of cancer accounts for the majority of cancer-related
deaths. CTCs have been established as a prognostic biomarker and are
associated with worse survival outcomes in various cancer types. However,
the implication of CTCs as a prognostic marker in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) has not yet been established. We have employed a flexible
micro spring array (FMSA) device for label-free mechanical enrichment of
CTCs from whole blood samples obtained from patients with advanced and
metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. CTCs were enriched and analyzed
qualitatively and quantitatively based on immunocytochemical
determination of phenotype and morphological characteristics. Follow up
samples were analyzed during the course of therapy and CTC results were
correlated to patient survival and tumor burden. FMSA enriched CTCs
obtained from a blood sample may prove to be a prognostic biomarker for
advanced lung cancer.
