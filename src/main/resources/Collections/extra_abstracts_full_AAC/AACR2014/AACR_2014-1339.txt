Title: Endoplasmic reticulum stress mediates Tanshinone I induced
apoptosis in mesothelioma cells


Malignant Mesothelioma (MM) is a highly aggressive tumor caused by
asbestos exposure with poor survival rate. Here, we investigated
anti-cancer mechanism of Tanshinone I on mesothelioma cells. Tanshinone I
exerted significant cytotoxicity in a time and dose dependent manner in
mesothelioma cell lines such as MSTO-211H, H28, and H2452 cells, but not
in MeT-5A cells. Also, Tanshinone I increased sub-G1 population and TUNEL
positive stained cells in three mesothelioma cells. Consistently,
Tanshinone I cleaved poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) and attenuated
the expression of pro-caspase9, pro-caspase3 and Bcl2 as well as the
phosphorylation of JNK and PI3K in three mesothelioma cells. Furthermore,
Tanshinone I exerted significant cytotoxicity in a time and dose
dependent manner in mesothelioma up-regulated the expression of
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers such as CHOP, GRP78, ATF4, and
IRE-1 in three mesothelioma cells. The apoptotic ability of Tanshinone I
to cleave PARP and activate caspase 9/3 in in three mesothelioma cells.
Overall, these findings suggest that Tanshinone I exhibits anti-tumor
effect in MSTO-211H, H28, and H2452 cells via up-regulation of ER stress
signaling as a potent anticancer agent for the mesothelioma cells.
