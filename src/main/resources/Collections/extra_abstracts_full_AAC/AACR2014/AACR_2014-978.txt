Title: microRNA-211 modulates energy metabolism in human melanoma cells
by destabilizing HIF1- and downregulating PDK4


MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play critical roles in
cellular physiology and tumorigenesis. We have previously reported that
the expression of the melanocyte-specific miRNA miR-211 is significantly
reduced or absent in non-pigmented melanoma cells and clinical melanoma
samples. Here we report that ectopic expression of miR-211 in
non-pigmented melanoma cells increases mitochondrial number, NADP to
NADPH ratio, oxygen consumption, and fatty acid synthesis. Ectopic
expression of miR-211 destabilizes hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and
downregulates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), which is known to
convert cellular pyruvate to acetyl co-enzyme A. miR-211-expressing cells
were characterized by uptake of glutamine, rather than glucose, as a
source of cellular energy. Global proteomic, transcriptomic, lipidomic,
and metabolomic profiling with integrated analysis revealed that miR-211
modulates several -omics signatures associated with oxidative
phosphorylation. Here we show for the first time that a microRNA and its
target genes play a key role in regulating mitochondrial energy
metabolism in melanomas.
