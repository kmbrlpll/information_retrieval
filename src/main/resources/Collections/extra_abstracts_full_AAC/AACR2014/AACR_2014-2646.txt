Title: Building a powerful ADCs discovery and development platform with
novel dolastatin/auristatin payloads


A family of novel warheads derived from dolastatins or auristatins were
designed and synthesized. They showed similar or better antitumor
activities against several typical cancer cell lines compared with
dolastatin 10 or monomethylauristatin E or F. The conjugated ADCs with
Trastuzumab have showed potent activities against Her2 breast cancer cell
lines. The validated platform with novel cytotoxins can be potentially
used to ADCs discovery and development.
