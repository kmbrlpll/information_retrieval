Title: Real-time FUCCI imaging demonstrates targeting dormant cancer cells


Screening for agents that specifically kill quiescent cancer cells has
not been possible due to the inability to readily identify these cells.
Using cancer cells expressing a fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell
cycle indicator (FUCCI), we describe here an approach to screening for
agents against dormant tumor spheres consisting of cancer stem-like cells
expressing CD133. In the FUCCI system, cycling cells have green
fluorescent nuclei and quiescent cells contain nuclei which fluoresce
red. FUCCI-expressing cancer cells in tumor spheres had predominantly red
nuclei after more than 7 days without cell division. Conventional
anticancer agents did not kill these quiescent cells. In contrast, the
genetically-engineered oncolytic adenovirus OBP301 and Salmonella
typhimurium A1-R induced quiescent cancer cells to cycle and become
sensitive to DNA-damaging chemotherapy. This imaging technology provides
a novel platform for visualizing trafficking candidate therapeutic agents
that could decoy dormant cancer cells to cycle and become chemosensitive.
