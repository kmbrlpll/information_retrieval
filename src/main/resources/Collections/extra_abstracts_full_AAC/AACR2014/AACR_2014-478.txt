Title: Predicting interactome networks perturbations in human cancer:
application to gene fusions in acute lymphoblastic leukemia


Genomic variations such point mutations and gene fusions are directly or
indirectly associated with human diseases. They are recognized as
diagnostic, prognostic markers and as therapeutic targets. However,
predicting the functional impact of these genetic alterations beyond
affected genes and their products is challenging because diseased
phenotypes likely result in complex molecular interaction networks. Using
as models three different chromosomal translocations ETV6-RUNX1
(TEL-AML1), BCR-ABL1, and E2A-PBX1 (TCF3-PBX1) frequently found in B-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we develop an approach to extract
from gene expression changes, perturbed molecular interactions. We show
that the Myc and JunD transcriptional circuits are specifically
deregulated following TEL-AML1 and TCF3-PBX1 gene fusions, respectively.
We also identified the bulk mRNA NXF1-dependent machinery as a direct
target for the TCF3-PBX1 fusion protein. Through a novel approach
combining gene expression and interactome data analysis, we provide new
insight into TCF3-PBX1 and TEL-AML1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Note:
