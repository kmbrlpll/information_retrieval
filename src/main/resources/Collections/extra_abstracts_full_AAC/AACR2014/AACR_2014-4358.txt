Title: MicroRNA-198 inhibits non-small cell lung cancer migration and
invasion through targeting OTX1 and VCP


Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide,
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for the majority of
cases. In previous studies, microRNA-198 (miR-198) was shown to be
significantly downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma-associated malignant
pleural effusion and suggested as a diagnostic biomarker. Herein, we show
that miR-198 regulates migration and invasion of NSCLS cells by directly
targeting orthodenticle homeobox 1 (OTX1) and valosin containing protein
(VCP). Expression of miR-198 suppressed migration and invasion of NSCLS
cells, whereas inhibition of miR-198 expression increased the invasive
efficiency of the cancer cells. MiR-198 directly targets 3UTR of OTX1 and
VCP, thus regulates their protein level. Furthermore, we found reduced
levels of miR-198 in human NSCLS tissue samples compared to adjacent
normal tissues. Our findings indicate that miR-198 regulates NSCLC cell
migration and invasion, partially via the down-regulation of OTX1 and
VCP. Thus, miR-198 may represent a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC
intervention.
