Title: GS-19, a novel GSK inhibitor suppresses the growth of pancreatic
cancer cells by inhibiting EGFR/AKT/STAT-3 signaling


Pancreatic cancer remains the fourth leading cause of cancer related
deaths in the United States. Therefore, identification of novel
strategies to control and treat pancreatic cancer is of great importance.
GS-19 is a novel compound recently found to be a GSK inhibitor. In this
study, we determined the anti-cancer effects of GS-19 in pancreatic
cancer cells. GS-19 treatment inhibited the growth of Panc-1 and BxPC-3
cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Both the cell lines treated
with GS-19 exhibited G-1 cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis. Western
blot analysis of both BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells treated with GS-19
inhibited the activation (phosphorylation) and expression of key survival
signaling proteins such as EGFR, STAT3 and AKT. The apoptosis induced by
GS-19 was associated with cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. Taken together,
our results suggest that GS-19 suppress pancreatic cancer cell growth by
inhibiting EGFR/AKT/STAT-3 signaling. However, further mechanistic
studies are in progress to establish the role of EGFR/AKT/STAT-3
signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. [The studies in part were supported
