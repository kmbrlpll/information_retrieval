Title: BET bromodomain inhibition triggers apoptosis of NF1-associated
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors through Bim induction


Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive
sarcomas that develop sporadically or in Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)
patients. MPNSTs are typically fatal, and effective treatments remain
limited. To gain insights into MPNST pathogenesis, we utilized a novel
MPNST mouse model that allowed us to study the evolution of these tumors
at the transcriptome level. Strikingly, in MPNSTs we found upregulation
of chromatin regulator Brd4, and show that BRD4 inhibition profoundly
suppresses both growth and tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal new roles
for BET bromodomains in MPNST development, and report a novel mechanism
by which bromodomain inhibition induces apoptosis through induction of
pro-apoptotic Bim, which may represent a paradigm shift in therapy for
MPNST patients. Moreover, these findings indicate novel epigenetic
mechanisms underlying the balance of anti-/pro-apoptotic molecules, and
suggest that bromodomain inhibition can shift this balance in favor of
cancer cell apoptosis.
