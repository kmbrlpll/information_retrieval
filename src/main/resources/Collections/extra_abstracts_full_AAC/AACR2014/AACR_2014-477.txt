Title: The dynamic changes of KLF4 in the oral squamous cell
carcinogenesis


KLF4 (formerly GKLF) is a zinc-finger transcription factor expressed in
the epithelia of the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and several
other organs. In vitro studies have suggested that KLF4 plays an
important role in cell proliferation and/or differentiation. Several
studies implied that KLF4 is associated with both tumour suppression and
oncogenesis, but the function of KLF4 in the oral carcinogenesis has not
been investigated. To address this issue we have generated an animal
model of experimental tongue cancerous lesions in C57BL/6J mouse by using
carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) in drinking water .And we
detected the KLF4 expression in mouse tongue precancerous and cancer
lesions by immunohistochemistry. Normally KLF4 was strongly expressed in
the nuclei of mice tongue epithelial cells. The staining of KLF4 was
gradually decreased from normal epithelial to hyperplasia to dysplasia,
and markedly decreased in the squamous cell carcinomas. The results
indicated that KLF4 could served as a tumour-suppressor functions in the
oral carcinogenesis.
