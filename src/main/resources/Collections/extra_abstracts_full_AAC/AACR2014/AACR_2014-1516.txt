Title: Automated circulating DNA purification from large volumes of plasma


The circulating DNA found in human plasma is enriched for genomic DNA
from minority tissues such as tumors, fetuses, and transplanted tissue.
This sub fraction of blood has become an area of interest for development
and disease as the nucleic acid recovered may represent a source of
biomarkers for study. One milliliter of plasma typically yields between 1
ng and 50 ng of DNA. The current commercial DNA purification methods
limit researchers' ability to scale their samples in both volume and
number. Automated solutions are not available to process large numbers of
samples with volumes greater than 1 ml, and manual methods can process up
to 5 ml of plasma. Here we present a fully automated solution to extract
DNA from 1-64 samples up to 8 ml in volume. The system provides an
intuitive user interface to select run options and enter barcodes for
reagents and samples. Any combination of sample volumes may be processed
together in a single run. Samples are eluted in 50 l of nuclease-free
water in either plates or tubes. We have found that the performance of
our system meets or exceeds common commercial alternatives over their
common sample input volume.
