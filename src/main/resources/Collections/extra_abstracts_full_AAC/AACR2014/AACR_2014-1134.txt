Title: Slug promotes survival during metastasis through suppression of
Puma-mediated apoptosis


Tumor cells must overcome apoptosis to survive throughout metastatic
dissemination and distal organ colonization. Here we show in the Polyoma
Middle T mammary tumor model that N-cadherin causes Slug upregulation,
which promotes carcinoma cell survival. Slug was dramatically upregulated
in distant metastases relative to primary tumors. Consistent with a role
in metastasis, Slug knockdown in metastatic carcinoma cells suppressed
pulmonary colonization, due to reducing cell survival, but had no effect
on tumor cell invasion or extravasation. In support of a role in cell
survival, Slug inhibition by shRNA, sensitized tumor cells to apoptosis
by genotoxic stress, resulting in caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage.
Furthermore, the effects of Slug on cell survival were due to direct
repression of the pro-apoptotic gene, Puma. Importantly, the survival
function of the SLUG-PUMA axis was confirmed in human breast cancer
cells, where Slug knockdown increased Puma expression and inhibited lung
colonization. Thus, our study demonstrates a pivotal role for Slug in
cell survival, which is beyond its role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition, implying that disruption of the SLUG-PUMA axis may impinge on
the survival of metastatic cancer cells.
