Title: TTC36, a novel chaperone of heat shock protein 70, functions as a
tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma


Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most devastating human
diseases characterized by high incidences and mortality rates. However,
there is still limited knowledge of molecular mechanisms leading to the
development of HCC. By using transcriptome sequencing profiling of
non-tumor and HCC samples, a subset of differentially expressed genes
have been identified. One of those genes, the TTC36 gene is
down-regulated in HCC tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. Reduced
expression of TTC36 is correlated with advanced tumor stages and
decreased overall survival. Ectopic expression of TTC36 in HCC cells show
decreased tumorigenic ability in vitro and vivo function assays.
Silencing TTC36 expression with short hairpin RNA had the opposite
effects. We had found that TTC36 promoted apoptosis of HCC cells by
interacting with heat shock protein 70 and induced the activation of
caspases-9, caspase-3 and PARP. Further characterization of TTC36 may
provide a novel prognostic biomarker for HCC and shed light on better
management of HCC treatment.Note: This abstract was not presented at the
