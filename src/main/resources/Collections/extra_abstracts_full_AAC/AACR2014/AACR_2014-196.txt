Title: Targeting breast cancer stem cells with a panel of potential
ALDH1A3 inhibitors


Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) isoform ALDH1A3 is selectively expressed in
breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) and is a key mediator in breast cancer
progression via initiation of retinoic acid (RA) signaling and expression
of RA-inducible genes. Expression of ALDH1A3 and its induced RA-inducible
genes are associated with less favorable patient outcomes. This suggests
that ALDH1A3 represents a novel anti-breast cancer therapeutic target. To
target the specific ALDH1A3 isoform, a panel of general ALDH inhibitors
was attained and the compounds effectiveness in targeting ALDH1A3
activity was quantified by their ability to decrease expression of the
downstream genes retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR) and retinoic acid
receptor responder protein 1 (RARRES1). Eleven compounds were tested in
total, and the essential oil citral was shown to significantly decrease
ALDH1A3-mediated expression of both RA-inducible genes in a dose
dependent manner. Citral is already used in cosmetics and food additives
and recent work shows that it can induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells
making it a promising therapeutic agent and a potential subject of a
future xenograft study in mice to determine its effects on CSCs in vivo.
