Title: Inhibition of R-spondin (RSPO) signaling reduces the growth of
multiple human tumors


Deregulation of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway has long
been associated with cancer. Intracellular components of this pathway,
including Axin, APC, and beta-catenin are frequently mutated in a range
of human tumors. The identity of specific extracellular ligands that
contribute to human cancer development through this signaling axis has
remained unclear. Molecular characterization of the secreted beta-catenin
signaling activities produced by minimally passaged human tumor xenograft
models identified RSPO family members produced by multiple tumor types
including ovarian, pancreatic, colon, breast and non-small cell lung
cancer. In human tumor xenograft models that had RSPO overexpression, in
some instances due to genomic translocation, anti-RSPO treatment markedly
inhibited tumor growth. In addition, striking combination activity with
standard of care chemotherapy agents resulted in regression of
established tumors. These results highlight the potential for therapeutic
intervention with this newly appreciated signaling axis.
