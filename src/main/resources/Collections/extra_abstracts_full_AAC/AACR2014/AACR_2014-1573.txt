Title: TUSC4 functions as tumor suppressor by regulating BRCA1 stability
and functions


Expression of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor is frequently lost in breast
cancer and associated with aggressive phenotypes through as yet
undetermined mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that the tumor
suppressor TUSC4 (Tumor Suppressor Candicate 4) physically interacts with
multiple DNA damage response proteins and prevent its degradation by E3
ligase ubqutination pathways. Knockdown of TUSC4 enhanced BRCA1
polyubiquitination, leading to BRCA1 protein degradation and
significantly reduced the efficacy of homologous recombination repair.
Notably, ectopic expression of TUSC4 effectively suppressed multiple
breast cancer cells proliferation, invasion, and colony formation in
vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, TUSC4 knockdown was
sufficient to transform normal mammary epithelial cells and enhance the
sensitivity of cells to PARP inhibitors. Microarray analysis of TUSC4
knockdown also indicated critical changes and the global impact to cancer
development. Therefore, TUSC4 acts as a bona fide tumor suppressor gene
through the mechanism of regulating BRCA1 protein stability and function.
