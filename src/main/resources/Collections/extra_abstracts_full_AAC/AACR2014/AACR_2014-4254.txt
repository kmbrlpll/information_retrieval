Title: ESE1 binds to beta catenin and modulates its expression


ESE-1 is an epithelium-specific transcription factor that functions in
the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. ESE-1's structure
predicts its interaction with a number of other proteins with various
cellular functions. Previously we have shown that tolfenamic acid (TA)
could induce nuclear translocation of ESE1 in colorectal cancer cells,
and plays a critical role in the activation of apoptosis. Here we show
that -catenin, an important protein regulating cell-cell adhesion and
gene transcription, binds and colocalizes with ESE-1 in cell cytoplasm.
The binding sites were mapped to carboxy terminus ESE-1, which includes
the ETS domain, and N-terminus of -catenin, which contains several
important phosphorylation sites. C-terminus of ESE1 also binds to
-catenin, and ESE1/ -catenin interaction was abrogated with suppression
of either -catenin or -catenin in HEK293 cells by si RNA treatment;
moreover, suppression of both -catenin and -catenin further impaired
ESE1/ -catenin binding. Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous ESE1
significantly decreased -catenin level in HCT116 cells. Current data
support a role of ESE1 in the regulation of -catenin function in colon
cancer.
