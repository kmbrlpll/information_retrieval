Title: Re-analysis of breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) TCGA copy number
data improves tumor profiles


Using the copy number and SNP- probes available in the TCGA level 1 data,
reprocessed tumor profiles were more consistent with a control set in
terms of median number of copy number events, sample ploidy, and
breakpoint genes than the published level 3 TCGA data. Probe-level data
were analyzed using Nexus Copy Number SNP-FASST2 (a multi-state HMM
algorithm that uses both SNP and copy number probes in making state
assignments), with systematic correction applied to correct for GC
biases. Additionally we performed manual baseline adjustment to correct
for sample ploidy based on whole-genome B-alelle frequency data for each
sample. The median number of copy number events in the TCGA data set was
reduced from 377 (in the level 3 set) to 193, with a corresponding
reduction in variance, and in line with our control samples (median CN
changes of 173 and 142). After manual inspection, more than 15% of the
TCGA BRCA samples available at level 3 were found to have incorrect
baseline ploidy assignments. The resultant reanalyzed data set, along
with associated clinical annotations for each sample, is available
through Nexus DB repository to the general scientific community and
should provide greater utility for further research.
