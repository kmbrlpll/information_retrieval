Title: Uncovering novel PERK signaling pathways through chemical-genetic
screening


The ER kinase PERK, a key mediator of the Unfolded Protein Response, is
known to promote tumorigenesis, cell migration, and metastasis, as well
as inhibit anoikis. Though PERK has these and other important cellular
functions, only a handful of its direct substrates are currently known.
Therefore, in order to provide an expanded view of PERK function and
further definition of its signaling networks, we have used a
chemical-genetic approach to screen for additional PERK substrates. We
find that a mutation in the PERK ATP binding pocket renders it sensitive
to bulky ATP analogs both in vitro and in cells. Furthermore, bulky ATPS
analogs were used exclusively by the analog-sensitive version of PERK to
label substrates with thiophosphate. After labeling, thiophosphopeptides
were affinity purified by covalent capture and subsequently identified by
tandem mass spectrometry. Utilization of this analog-sensitive PERK
allele for substrate characterization will be discussed.
