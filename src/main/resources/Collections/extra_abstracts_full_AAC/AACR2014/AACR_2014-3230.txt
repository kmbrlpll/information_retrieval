Title: Genome-wide localization of anti-cancer drugs


A vast number of small-molecule ligands, including therapeutic drugs
under development and in clinical use, elicit their effects by binding
specific proteins associated with the genome. An ability to map the
direct interactions of a chemical entity with chromatin genome-wide could
provide new and important insights into the mechanisms by which such
small molecules interfere with tumor cell functions. We have developed a
method that couples affinity capture of chemical entities and massively
parallel DNA sequencing (Chem-seq) to identify the sites bound by small
molecules throughout the human genome. Using Chem-seq, we have uncovered
the full repertoire of the genomic sites bound by a BET bromodomain
inhibitor, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor and a DNA
intercalating drug. Moreover, by combining Chem-seq with ChIP-seq, we
have characterized the interactions of drugs with their targets
throughout the genome of tumor cells. These methods provide a powerful
approach to enhance understanding of therapeutic action and characterize
the specificity of drugs that interact with DNA or genome-associated
proteins.
