Title: Global mapping of tyrosine kinase signalling in breast cancer by
combined use of RNAi and SILAC quantitative proteomics


Dysregulation of protein tyrosine kinases (TKs) signalling can contribute
to tumorigenesis. However, less than half of the 90 TKs described so far
have been thoroughly studied and even in these cases a global functional
analysis is still lacking. A combined use of RNA interference (RNAi) and
stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) was
applied in breast cancer MCF7 cells. After knocking down individually
each TK, a proteomic map consisting of 3,000 regulated proteins per TK
was acquired.Quantitative and statistical analyses resulted in the
clustering of the significantly modulated proteins/TK into various
biological and molecular categories.Further use of mathematical modelling
tools resulted in a new classification and phylogeny of the TK family
members depending on connections between their regulated proteomes. This
taxonomy has little overall correlation when compared to their catalytic
domain sequence grouping. These data suggest that despite the primary
structure homology of kinases, their regulated proteomic landscapes can
significantly vary and may depend on other factors, notably their dynamic
interactions with other proteins.Our results and bionformatic analyses
will be presented.
