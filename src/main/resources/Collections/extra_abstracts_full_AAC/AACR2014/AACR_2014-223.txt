Title: High-throughput drug discovery against breast cancer stem cells


The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis postulates that tumors are
maintained by a self-renewing CSC population that is also capable of
differentiating into non-self renewing cell populations that constitute
the bulk of the tumor. Clinically, CSCs are predicted to mediate tumor
recurrence after chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to the relative
inability of these modalities to effectively target CSCs. Therefore, new
therapies that target CSC must be developed and combined with standard
therapy to achieve a true cure. Targeting breast CSC represents an
attractive avenue for developing therapeutics; however, there are
multiple pools of breast CSCs utilizing distinct signaling pathways, such
as Wnt/-catenin & NF-B. These breast CSC pools are identified using flow
cytometry as cells with high expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH),
CD44+CD24-, or CD90+. We have developed a high-throughput flow cytometry
based screen against CD90+ breast CSCs. We screened 18,500 small
molecules for inhibitors of CD90+ frequency and identified 19 compounds.
Here, we will present data examining this compounds against ALDH+, and
CD44+CD24- breast CSCs. By identifying compounds with that target
multiple pools of breast CSCs, these compounds might be exploited in
future drug development endeavors.
