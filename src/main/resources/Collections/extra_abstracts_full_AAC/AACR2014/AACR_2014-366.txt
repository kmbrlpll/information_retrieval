Title: Translational modeling of docetaxel-thalidomide combination
treatment in metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer: predicting
clinical response using preclinical data


A major cause of drug failure in the clinic is that preclinical studies
do not predict with sufficient certainty what will happen in clinical
practice. Accurately translating information from animal studies to the
clinic would have a major impact on attrition rate. We have developed a
mathematical model of a tumor cell population called the Virtual Tumour,
which has been used extensively to predict the efficacy of single drug or
drug combination treatment in preclinical studies. We have now extended
and adapted our preclinical model to predict efficacy in the clinic, thus
creating the Virtual Tumour Clinical. Here we show a comparative study of
the preclinical Virtual Tumour calibrated model for prostate tumor
xenografts in mice, with a Virtual Tumour Clinical version calibrated
with a clinical data set comprising 53 prostate cancer patients treated
with thalidomide, 25 treated with docetaxel and 50 treated with a
docetaxel and thalidomide combination. PSA measurements were used as
proxy for tumor size. We analysed the consistency, the capability and the
limitations of the models in translating the effect of the drug
combination from the preclinical situation to the clinic.
