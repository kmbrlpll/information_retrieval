Title: Time-lapse imaging of response to DNA damage occuring during
mitosis


The DNA damage response protein 53BP1 forming foci when double-stranded
breaks occur in DNA. In this study, the response to DNA damage during
mitosis was visualized using fluorescent protein-based real-time imaging
of 53BP1 linked to GFP (GFP-53BP1) focus formation by the fusion protein
in the MiaPaCa2 Tet-On Advanced cell line. The MiaPaCa2Tet-On GFP-53BP1
cells were cultured in 35 mm dishes for 48 h. 53BP1 foci were observed
every 30 minutes with the FluoView FV1000 confocal laser microscope
(Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The increased expression of GFP-53BP1 was
observed during mitosis in MiaPaCa2Tet-On GFP-53BP1 cells without any
treatment Mitotic changes were observed 1.09 0.10 times in each cell
during over 24 h. Apoptotic changes were observed in 7.3 3.3% of the
cells during the 24 h. During the time-lapse imaging, focus formation of
GFP-53BP1 was observed in 11.4 2.1% of the mitotic cells during over 24
h. Non-mitotic cells did not have an increase in GFP-53BP1 focus
formation. This study indicates that DNA strand breaks occur during
mitosis and can be repaired, at least to some extent.
