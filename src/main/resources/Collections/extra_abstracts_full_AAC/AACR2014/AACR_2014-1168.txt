Title: Cathelicidin is a novel mediator of cancer immune surveillance


Cathelicidins are evolutionarily conserved anti-microbial peptides that
have been identified in several epithelial tissues and a wide variety of
immune cells. These peptides display multiple host-defense activities, as
well as documented but underexplored antitumor activity. Using the
regressor MCA sarcoma system as a model of immune mediated tumor
rejection, we observed that deficiency in cathelicidin in cnlp-/- mice
impaired the rejection of multiple regressor cell lines. Cnlp-/- mice
also developed spontaneous lymphoma with age, thus confirming in a
separate model system the requirement for cathelicidin in tumor immune
surveillance. To decipher the immune defect that may engender impaired
tumor surveillance, macrophages from cnlp-/- versus wild type (wt) mice
were examined. Interestingly, cnlp-/- macrophages were defective in
polarizing towards an antitumor M1 phenotype and less potent at
phagocytosing target tumor cells.Altogether, these preliminary data
suggest a crucial role of cathelicidin in limiting tumor formation and
progression. Future experiments will define the role of cathelicidin in
tumor surveillance mediated by macrophages and potentially other innate
cells that also express cathelicidin, such as neutrophils and natural
killer cells.
