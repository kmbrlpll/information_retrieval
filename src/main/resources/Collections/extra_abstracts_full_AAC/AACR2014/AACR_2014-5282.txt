Title: Promotion of skin tumorigenesis by deletion of Ppp6c gene


Protein phosphatase-6 (PP6) is a member of type-2A protein-Ser/Thr
phosphatases, and reportedly regulates several cellular functions
including DNA damage responses, NF-kB activation, and mitotic spindle
formation. Additionally, some recent papers reported somatic mutations of
PPP6c gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of PP6, in about 10 % of
melanoma patients, suggesting its potential role as either driver or
suppressor of melanoma development.In this study, we generated mice, in
which the PPP6C gene is deleted in keratinocyte-specific manner
(PP6-KKO). PP6-KKO mice were predisposed to formation of skin tumor upon
DMBA-treatment. Our results demonstrate PPP6c has a tumor-suppressive
function at least in skin tumorigenesis.
