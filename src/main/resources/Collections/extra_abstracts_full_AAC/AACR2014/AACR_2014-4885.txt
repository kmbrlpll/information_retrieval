Title: Changes in abundance of oral microbiota associated with oral cancer


Individual bacteria and shifts in the composition of the microbiome have
been associated with human diseases including cancer. To investigate
changes in the microbiome associated with oral cancers, we profiled
cancers and anatomically matched contralateral normal tissue from the
same patient by sequencing 16S rDNA hypervariable region amplicons. In
cancer samples from both a discovery and a subsequent confirmation
cohort, abundance of Firmicutes (especially Streptococcus) and
Actinobacteria (especially Rothia) was significantly decreased relative
to contralateral clinically normal samples from the same patient.
Significant decreases in abundance of these phyla were observed for
pre-cancers, but not when comparing samples from contralateral sites
(tongue and floor of mouth) from healthy individuals. Patients with
cancer or dysplasia, however, could be distinguished from healthy normal
individuals by increased abundance of Prevotella. Weighted UniFrac
principal coordinates analysis based on 12 taxa separated most cancers
from other samples with greatest separation of node positive cases.
