Title: Correlation between number and sites of metastases and
differential pretreated EBV DNA load profiles and their effects on
outcomes in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma


Background: To investigate the relationship between pretreatment plasma
EBV DNA copy number and sites and numbers of metastases in patients with
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).Methods: One hundred and thirty-three
patients with metastatic NPC were treated at outpatient department. Their
plasma EBV DNA concentrations were determined by real-time quantitative
PCR.Results: The overall patient response rate after 3-6 months of
treatment was 48.1%. Pretreatment plasma EBV DNA concentrations were
lower in patients with solitary nodule (5,000 copies/mL, 18/25 [72%] vs.
multiple nodules, 49/128 [45.4%], P=0.025) or pure lung metastases (5,000
copies/mL, 19/21 [90.5%] vs. not lung metastases alone 48/112 [42.9%],
P5,000 copies/mL, median OS, 26 vs. 10 months; HR, 2.852; P5,000
copies/mL, median OS, 26 vs. 10 months; HR, 2.852; P<0.001).Conclusions:
Pretreatment plasma EBV DNA copy number correlated with number and sites
of metastases and with OS in patients with metastatic NPC.
