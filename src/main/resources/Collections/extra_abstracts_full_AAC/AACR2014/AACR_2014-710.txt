Title: The efficacy of tumor-targeting Salmonella typhimurium A1-R on
bone metastasis


We have previously developed a genetically-modified bacterial strain of
Salmonella typhimurium (A1-R), which expresses GFP. In this study, we
measured the efficacy of A1-R on breast cancer bone metastasis. We
established an early-stage bone-metastasis model in nude mice by cardiac
injection and a late-stage model by injection into the intramedullary
cavity of the tibia using MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells (Human
breast cancer cell lines co-express neuronal, epithelial, and melanocytic
differentiation markers in vitro and in vivo. PLoS One 5, e9712, 2010).
Both mouse models of bone metastasis were treated with A1-R. Fluorescence
imaging of the mice was performed to visualize the metastatic bone
lesions. In a first set of experiments, we showed that A1-R invaded and
replicated intracellularly in MDA-MB-435-GFP cells in vitro. A1-R
dose-dependently inhibited proliferation of MDA-MB-435-GFP cells. In the
early-stage bone-metastasis model, A1-R significantly improved
metastasis-free survival. In the advanced-stage bone-metastasis model,
A1-R significantly inhibited the growth of the metastatic lesions. These
data indicated that A1-R is useful to prevent and inhibit the growth of
metastatic breast cancer bone tumors.
