Title: Inhibition of mutant EGFR in lung cancer cells triggers SOX2-FOXO6
dependent survival pathways


Treatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancer with erlotinib results in dramatic
tumor regression but it is invariably followed by drug resistance. In
characterizing early transcriptional changes following drug treatment of
mutant EGFR-addicted cells, we identified the stem cell transcriptional
regulator SOX2 as being rapidly and specifically induced, both in vitro
and in vivo. Suppression of SOX2 sensitizes cells to erlotinib-mediated
apoptosis, whereas its ectopic expression reduces drug-induced cell
death. We show that erlotinib relieves EGFR-dependent suppression of
FOXO6, leading to SOX2 induction and repression of the pro-apoptotic
BH3-only genes BIM and BMF. Together, these observations point to a
physiological feedback mechanism that attenuates oncogene
addiction-mediated cell death and may contribute to the acquisition of
drug resistance.
