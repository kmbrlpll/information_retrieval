Title: MMP14 as PTP4A3 downstream target is involved in uveal melanoma
cell dissemination


Abstract: Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in
adults, representing 5% of all melanomas. Although at diagnosis over 95%
of patients have disease limited to the eye, about 50% will develop
metastases after a median period of 36 months. High expression levels of
Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 4A3 (PTP4A3), a dual phosphatase, is highly
predictive of metastasis development and PTP4A3 overexpression in uveal
melanoma cells increases their in vitro migration and in vivo
invasiveness. The PTP4A3 mechanism of action in the tumoral process is
poorly understood. We identified the metalloprotease MMP14 as an
interacting partner of PTP4A3. MMP14 is more abundant at the cell
membrane in PTP4A3 invasive cells compared to control cells (inactive
catalytic site mutant GFP-PTP4A3(C104S) or EGFP) and inhibition of MMP14
expression decreases PTP4A3-induced cell invasiveness. The
MMP14-differential cell membrane localization in presence of PTP4A3 is
currently investigated by studying the trafficking of MMP14 in these
cells.
