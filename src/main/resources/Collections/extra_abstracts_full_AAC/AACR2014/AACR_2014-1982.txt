Title: Invading cancer cells are mostly in G0/G1 and resist chemotherapy
demonstrated by real-time FUCCI imaging of cell-cycle kinetics in Gelfoam
histoculture


Invasive cancer cells are a critical target for chemotherapy in order to
prevent metastasis. In the present report, we demonstrate real-time
visualization of cell-cycle kinetics of invading cancer in
three-dimensional (3D) Gelfoam histoculture. A fluorescence
ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) was used whereby G1/G0 cells
express a red fluorescent protein and S/G2/M cells express a green
fluorescent protein. With FUCCI imaging, we observed that cancer cells in
G0/G1 phase in Gelfoam histoculture migrated more rapidly and further
than the cancer cells in S/G2/M phase. Cancer cells ceased migrating when
they entered S/G2/M phases and restarted migrating after division and
re-entry into G1/G0. Migrating cancer cells also were resistant to
chemotherapy since they were preponderantly in G1/G2 and cytotoxic
chemotherapy targets cells in S/G2/M phase. The results of the present
report suggest that novel therapy targeting G1/G2 cancer cells is
necessary to prevent metastasis.
