Title: Novel quantitative autophagy analysis by organelle flow cytometry
after cell sonication


Autophagy is a dynamic process of bulk degradation of cellular proteins
and organelles in lysosomes. Current methods of autophagy measurement
include microscopy-based counting of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in cells.
We have developed a novel method to quantitatively analyze individual AVs
using flow cytometry. This method, OFACS (organelle flow after cell
sonication), takes advantage of efficient cell disruption with a brief
sonication, generating cell homogenates with fluorescently labeled AVs
that retain their integrity as confirmed with light and electron
microscopy analysis. These AVs could be detected directly in the
sonicated cell homogenates on a flow cytometer as a distinct population
of expected organelle size on a cytometry plot. Treatment of cells with
inhibitors of autophagic flux, such as chloroquine or lysosomal protease
inhibitors, increased the number of particles in this population under
autophagy inducing conditions, while inhibition of autophagy induction
with 3-methyladenine or knockdown of ATG proteins prevented this
accumulation. This assay can be easily performed in a high-throughput
format and opens up previously unexplored avenues for autophagy analysis.
