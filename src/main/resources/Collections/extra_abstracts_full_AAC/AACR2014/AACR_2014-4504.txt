Title: Urokinase plasminogen activator-dependent tumor penetrating peptide


Activity of tumor penetrating peptides depends on C-end Rule (CendR)
peptide motif (R/KXXR/K) that must be C-terminally exposed for tissue and
cell penetration. We describe here a cryptic CendR peptide (uCendR; amino
acid sequence: RPARSGRSAGGSVA) that is proteolytically activated by
urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), a protease overexpressed in
human tumors. uPA cleavage unmasks the cryptic CendR element of uCendR
peptide and triggers its binding and internalization to the
neuropilin-expressing cultured cancer cells. Intradermally injected
post-cleavage mimic of uCendR peptide (RPARSGR) increases permeability of
skin microvessels to tracer compounds. Phage and silver nanoparticles
functionalized with uCendR peptide in combination with angiogenic
integrin-recruitment motif (CRGDC) home to tumor blood vessels,
extravasate, and trigger vascular exit of co-injected tracer compounds.
This study shows that modular tumor penetrating peptides that are
specifically activated by a tumor derived protease can be developed for
tumor-targeted drug delivery.
