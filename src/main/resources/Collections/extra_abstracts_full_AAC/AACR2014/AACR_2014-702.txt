Title: DCVex(TM): A novel integration-deficient lentivector technology
that incorporates genetic and post-translational elements to target
dendritic cells


With the goal of creating antigen-directed immunotherapeutics that can be
safely administered directly to patients, Immune Design has developed a
platform of novel integration-deficient lentiviral vectors that target
and deliver antigen-encoding nucleic acids to dendritic cells (DCs) in
order to promote the activation of antigen-specific effector CD8 T cells.
This platform, termed DCVex(TM), utilizes a novel genetic variant of a
Sindbis virus envelope glycoprotein with post-translational carbohydrate
modifications in combination with Vpx, a SIVmac viral accessory protein,
to achieve efficient targeting and transduction of DCs. In addition,
DCVex(TM) incorporates safety features in its design that include
redundant mechanisms to render DCVex(TM) integration-deficient, as well
as genetic modifications that eliminate psi-gag recombination between
split genome components. The characteristics that allow DCVex(TM) to
specifically transduce human DCs and the advances that DCVex(TM) brings
to conventional third-generation lentiviral vector design demonstrate its
potential as a vaccine designed to utilize DCs for cancer immunotherapy.
