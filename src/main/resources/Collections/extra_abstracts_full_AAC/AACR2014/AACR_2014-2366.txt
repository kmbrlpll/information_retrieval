Title: Transcriptome analysis of human metastasis prostate cancer cells
deciphers new function of Esrrb


Orphan nuclear receptor family member, Estrogen Related Receptor (esrrb)
became a research hot topic in recent years. Although the function of
esrrb is relatively well studied in stem cells and early embryonic
development, little is known about its function in cancer. Esrrb is
reported to arrest prostate cancer cell cell-cycle by upregulating p21.
Here we investigate the transcriptome alteration induced by esrrb
expression and its synthetic ligand DY131 in a human prostate cancer cell
line. We distinguished 205 qualified differentially expressed (DE) genes
regulated by esrrb alone, and 3202 genes with DY131 treatment with esrrb
expression, indicating esrrb has both ligand independent and ligand
dependent activity. From the esrrb-regulated transcriptome, we
established a hypothetical esrrb transcription regulation model in
prostate cancer cells by matching the DNA motif recognized by
transcriptional factors (TFs) to the promoter sequences of differentially
expressed genes. We found esrrb-regulated gene expression is mediated by
TAGLN, HOXB2 and HOXB8 from our model. Our findings potentially provide
multiple markers to characterize esrrb's function in prostate cancer.
