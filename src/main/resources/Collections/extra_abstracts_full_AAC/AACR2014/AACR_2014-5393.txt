Title: The advantages of acoustic liquid handling for drug sensitivity
screening


Recently identified associations between variants of cancer genes and
drug resistance have increased the value for comprehensive drug
sensitivity screening in combination with molecular profiling of cancer
cells. This in turn, has led to a demand for improvements to screening
throughput and efficiency. Echo Liquid Handlers use acoustic energy to
provide high throughput, non-contact, liquid handling for a range of
applications. Non-contact transfer avoids the risk of
cross-contamination, eliminates tip costs, and facilitates the
progression to high density assay formats. Echo Liquid handlers precisely
and accurately transfer 2.5 nL droplets of sample and reagent, which
enables the miniaturization of biochemical screens. This poster discusses
the implementation of miniaturized drug sensitivity screening, at the
Institute of Molecular Medicine in Finland (FIMM), with assay-ready
plates produced by the Echo liquid handler.
