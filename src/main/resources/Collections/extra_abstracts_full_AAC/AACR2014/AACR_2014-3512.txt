Title: MYCN and survivin cooperatively contribute to malignant
transformation of fibroblasts


The oncogenes MYCN and survivin (BIRC5) maintain aggressiveness of
diverse cancers including sarcomas. To investigate whether these
oncogenes cooperate in initial malignant transformation, we transduced
them into Rat-1 fibroblasts. Indeed, survivin enhanced MYCN-driven
contact-uninhibited and anchorage-independent growth in vitro.
Importantly, upon subcutaneous transplantation into mice, cells
overexpressing both instead of either one of the oncogenes generated
tumors with shortened latency, marked anaplasia and an increased
proliferation-to-apoptosis ratio resulting in accelerated growth.
Mechanistically, the increased tumorigenicity was associated with an
enhanced Warburg effect and HIF1-linked vascular remodeling. This
cooperation between MYCN and survivin may be important in the genesis of
several cancers.
