Title: JNK2 oligomerization regulates its activation through
non-canonical pathways


C-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) regulate various cellular functions.
Their activation is mediated cooperatively by both MKK4 and MKK7. The
c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) isoform is constitutively activated in
glial tumor cell lines and human glioblastoma models. We investigated the
regulation of JNK2 self-activation in vitro in both cell-free and
cell-based experiments. Light scattering analysis suggested that
unphosphorylated recombinant JNK22 exists in solution as a mixture of
monomers, dimers and tetramers. JNK22 self-phosphorylates more rapidly in
vitro when assayed at low concentration leading to its activation.
However, at a slightly higher concentration, the formation of a tetramer
is favored, whose ability to self-phosphorylate is suppressed. HEK293T
cells that were transfected with varying amounts of pcDNA-JNK22 showed
that an increased concentration of JNK22 (54 kDa) could suppress the
appearance of activated JNK22 in mammalian cells. A mutant of JNK2
(F170R) thought to stabilize the DFG-out conformation appears to
stabilize the formation of a JNK2 tetramer. Taken together our data
suggest that oligomerization may regulate non-canonical (self-activation)
activation of JNK2.
