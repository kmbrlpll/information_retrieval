Title: The ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor Didox reverses tamoxifen
resistance in breast cancer cells


Tamoxifen is the most prescribed endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor
positive breast cancer patients. The emergence of endocrine resistance is
a major hurdle in achieving a successful clinical outcome. Many advances
have been made over the past few years to understand the biology of
tamoxifen resistance. Activation of the AKT kinase is one of the primary
mechanisms of intrinsic tamoxifen resistance. Previously, we reported
that the Ribonucleotide Reductase M2 (RRM2) subunit is upregulated in AKT
induced tamoxifen resistance and that inhibition of RRM2 by siRNA
mediated interference reduces tamoxifen induced cell proliferation. In
this study, we report that the inhibition of RRM2 by the small molecule
inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase activity Didox (3,
4-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid), significantly reduced tamoxifen induced
cell proliferation in AKT overexpressing cells and tamoxifen resistant
tumors generated by these cells. As well, Didox in combination with
tamoxifen also inhibited cell proliferation in acquired tamoxifen
resistant breast cancer cell lines. Employing comprehensive cell culture
and in vivo models, we demonstrate that combining tamoxifen with Didox
may reverse tamoxifen resistance in AKT expressing breast cancer cells.
