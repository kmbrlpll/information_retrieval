Title: Aneuploidy is in stomatin overexpressed cells


A 31.5 kDa membrane associated protein which is highly abundant in the
lipid rafts is stomatin. Human gene expression profile from UCSC Genome
Bioinformatics databank indicates that stomatin is major in the
peripheral blood, adipose tissue, muscle, and bone marrow. In the
beginning, stomatin was thought to be involved in the disease OHSt
(overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis), and therefore named stomatin.
However, later studies did not reveal mechanistic role of stomatin in
mediating OHSt by evaluating stomatin gene deleted mice; the function of
stomatin is therefore remained unclear. In this study, we found that
overexpression of stomatin was able to induce the multinucleated cell
formation. Our data also demonstrated that stomatin made in the cytoplasm
could be transported outside of the cell and released to the culture
medium. While adding the culture medium or condition medium to the cells,
which did not contain exogenous stomatin, these cells were also triggered
to undergo formation of multinucleated cells. Additionally, the stomatin
induced multinucleated cells presented aneuploidy and abnormal centrosome
number. Possible mechanisms underlying functions of stomatin that induce
multinucleated cells are investigated.Note: This abstract was not
presented at the meeting.
