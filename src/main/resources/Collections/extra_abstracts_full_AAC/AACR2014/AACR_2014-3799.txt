Title: Urokinase kringle-derived peptide UP-7 potently inhibits
angiogenesis and tumor growth


The recombinant kringle domain of urokinase-type plasminogen activator
(UK1) has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and
suppress brain tumor in vivo. UK1 consists of 83 amino acids and has 2
short helices, rudimentary -sheets and one extended antiparallel -sheets
regions. In order to identify functional core sequence of the UK1 for
angiogenesis inhibition, we examined the anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor
activities for the seven UK1-derived peptides. Among the tested peptides,
UP-7 potently inhibited the proliferation and migration of endothelial
cells in vitro and suppressed vessel formation in Matrigel plugs in vivo.
However, such anti-angiogenic activities were not exerted by the
scrambled peptide UP7-SC7 or UP7-derived shorter peptides. UP-7 also
suppressed VEGF-induced phosphorylation of FAK and ERK1/2 in endothelial
cells. In a NCI-H460 lung cancer xenografted animal model, UP-7
effectively inhibited tumor growth. In addition, treatment of mice
bearing MDA-MB231 tumor with UP-7 peptide resulted in a dose-dependent
inhibition of tumor growth. Taken together, these results suggest that
UK1- derived novel peptide UP-7 can be used for treatment of cancers.
