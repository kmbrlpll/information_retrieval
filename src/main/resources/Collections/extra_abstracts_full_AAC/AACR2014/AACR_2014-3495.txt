Title: A nucleolus-predominant piggyBac transposase increases
transposition efficiency in human cancer cells


PiggyBac is a prevalent transposon system used to deliver transgenes into
and to functionally explore the mammalian untouched genomic territory.
Efforts to increase its transposition efficiency in mammals through
engineering the corresponding transposase (PBase) codon usage to improve
its expression level is reported. The hyperactive PBase developed through
screening for mutant variants are also established. To increase the
safety for its potential use in regenerative medicine applications,
site-specific transposition using engineered Zn finger-, Gal4- fused
PBase, and an excision-prone PBase variant are also successfully
developed. Here we report the construction of a nucleolus predominant
PBase, NP-mPB, by adding a nucleolus predominant (NP) signal peptide from
HIV-1 TAT protein to a mammalian codon optimized PBase (mPB). Although
there is a predominant fraction of the NP-mPB-tGFP fusion proteins
concentrated in the nucleoli, an insertion site preference toward
nuleolar organizer regions (NORs) is not detected. Instead a 3-fold
increase in piggyBac transposition efficiency is found in human cancer
cell line.
