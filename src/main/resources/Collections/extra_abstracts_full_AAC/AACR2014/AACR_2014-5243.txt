Title: MicroRNAs-449a and -449b exhibit tumor suppressive effects in
retinoblastoma


MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that act by inhibiting
target genes. Specific individual miRNAs have now been identified which
have confirmed effects in cancer, and some miRNAs can act as either tumor
suppressors or as oncogenes by exerting effects on important regulatory
cellular pathways. The purpose of our study is to illustrate the
relationship between the expressions of miRs-449a and -449b to
retinoblastoma proliferation and apoptosis. We show that there is an
inhibitory effect of miRs-449a and -449b in retinoblastoma by
demonstrating significantly impaired proliferation and increased
apoptosis of tumor cells when these miRNAs are overexpressed. This study
suggests that these miRNAs could serve as viable therapeutic targets for
retinoblastoma treatment. We also report the utility of combining
overexpression of miRs-449a and -449b with broad-based chemotherapy drugs
that are currently being used to treat retinoblastoma patients.
