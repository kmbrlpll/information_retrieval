Title: SSU72 functions as a gatekeeper monitoring for chromosome
integrity in mammals


Ssu72 has been initially identified as a protein phosphatase in yeast. It
is becoming increasingly clear that Ssu72 plays a major modifier in
regulating the transcriptional dynamics through the dephosphorylation
(hypophosphorylation) of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain. Despite
these intriguing reports, the physiological function of SSU72 remains
unknown particularly in higher eukaryotes. Recently, We have reported
that Ssu72 functions as a cohesin-binding phosphatase in regulating
sister chromatid cohesion. In addition, we generated the SSU72
conditional knock-out mice, and identified that SSU72 requirement for
monitoring hepatic chromosome ploidy and hepatic damage responses in
mammals. Furthermore, this study includes the physiology of SSU72
loss-of-function and the novel molecular lesions caused by SSU72 loss in
vitro and in vivo.
