Title: Genetically-engineered mice as a cell line isolating tool


BACKGROUNDIsolation of cell lines from patients tumors is difficult, due
in large part, to contaminating fibroblasts that often overgrow the
malignant cells. The same is true of xenografted tumors. To overcome this
problem, we developed biochemically selectable mouse cells by using
genetically-engineered mice.METHODSWe constructed a series of
hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) null immunodeficient mice.
These include nude hprt-null, SCID hprt-null and NOD-SCID hprt-null
mice.Tumors from patients were implanted into these mice for growth.
During growth of xenografted human cancers, hprt-null murine stromal
cells replace their human counterparts to facilitate the growth of human
cancer cells. Explanted tumors were then grown in tissue culture flasks
with selection media (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymine; HAT media) to
eliminate the mouse biochemically-defective fibroblasts and produce pure
human cancer cell lines.RESULTSWe successfully established several
pancreatic cancer cell lines and an ovarian cancer cell line from
patients using the hprt null immunodeficient mice.CONCLUSIONSThe new cell
line isolating system using genetically-engineered mice provides a
greater chance to isolate pure cancer cell lines from patients tumors.
This may allow personalized chemotherapy selection.
