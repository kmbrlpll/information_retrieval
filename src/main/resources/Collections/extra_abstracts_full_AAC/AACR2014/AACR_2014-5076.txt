Title: Rapid assessment of AML genes for mutation detection and copy
number variation


Targeted sequencing using the Ion AmpliSeq Library kit combined with the
Ion PGM sequencing instrument is a fast and effective method to identify
genetic variants in cancer samples. A new targeted primer panel for
amplification of genes involved in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) has been
developed by Life Technologies. The panel covers 19 genes characterized
using over 300 specific primer pairs in two highly multiplexed PCRs. To
demonstrate the coverage efficiency, we evaluated libraries prepared from
whole blood and isolated genomic DNA. When libraries from 4 individuals
were run on a single Ion 318 Chip, the average coverage depth was >3000x,
with >97% of the target bases covered >500X. Additionally, >90% of reads
were on-target. The panel was tested on control samples and analyzed
using the Ion Reporter Software, and expected variants, including copy
number variations (CNVs) were detected with high sensitivity and
specificity.
