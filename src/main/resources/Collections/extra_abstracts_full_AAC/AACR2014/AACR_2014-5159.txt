Title: The histone methyltransferase SUV39H2 is a novel target of
anticancer therapy


Besides genetic disorders, dysregulation of epigenetic machinery has been
proved to play a crucial role in human carcinogenesis, and the histone
methylation/demethylation process has been considered as one of key
regulators for this event. In this study, we demonstrate that one of the
HMTs, suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 2 (SUV39H2), plays pivotal
roles in human carcinogenesis. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that
SUV39H2 is aberrantly overexpressed in lung cancer, bladder cancer and
multiple myeloma compared with their corresponding normal tissues, and
immunohistochemical analysis revealed its positive staining in 251 out of
392 lung cancer cases and 16 of 29 bladder cancer cases, while no
significant staining was observed in various normal tissues we examined.
cDNA microarray analysis using a number of clinical tissues also confirms
overexpression of SUV39H2 in various types of cancer. SUV39H2-specific
small interfering RNAs significantly knocked down its expression, and
caused the G1 arrest as well as suppression of cancer cell growth. Since
SUV39H2 expression was undetectable in the normal tissues, SUV39H2 is
considered to be an ideal target for development of tumor-specific
therapeutics.
