Title: Accurate and fast detection and comparison of larger clinically
relevant insertions and deletions


Larger somatic insertions and deletions in tumor samples are often of
significant clinical impact. Many of them are cancer driver mutations and
play an important role in drug treatment1.Detecting the accurate
breakpoints of larger insertions and deletions is often problematic and
inaccurate. Furthermore, due to ambiguous positioning of them in the
human genome, they are hard to compare with known deletions and
insertions in publicly available databases.Here we present a complete
analysis workflow to accurate identify, filter and annotate larger
insertions and deletions with information from publicly available
databases such as COSMIC. We apply our pipeline on publicly available
tumor/normal matched pair data from a patient with Massive Acinic Cell
Carcinoma (A. Nichols et al. (2013) Case Reports in Oncological Medicine,
Article ID 270362), which has not been investigated for larger insertions
and deletions before. We show that we can identify insertions and
deletions, which should be reported as part of the list of somatic
variants, the authors have presented. Moreover, we will point out
potential challenges and how to solve them while comparing own results to
data in databases.
