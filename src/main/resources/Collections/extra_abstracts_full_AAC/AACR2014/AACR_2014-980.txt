Title: Small molecule inhibitor of miR-155, SMM155I, inhibits
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor growth in cancer cells
overexpressing miR-155


Accumulating studies have shown that miR-155 is frequently up-regulated
in a various types of human malignancy. Expression of miR-155 induces
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), transformation, tumor growth and
metastasis as well as chemoresistance, whereas inhibition of miR-155
reverses these processes. Here we report the discovery of a small
molecule miR-155 inhibitor, SMM155I, by screening the National Cancer
Institute Diversity Set. SMM155I directly binds to miR-155 and inhibits
miR-155 interaction with its targeted mRNAs without effect on expression
of miR-155 and other miRs. The inhibition of miR-155 by SMM155I resulted
in suppression of cell migration, invasion and EMT in human cancer cells
that harbor elevated miR-155. Furthermore, SMM155I potently inhibited
tumor growth in nude mice of human cancer cells in which miR-155 is
aberrantly expressed but not of those cancer cells in which it is not.
These findings provide strong evidence for pharmacologically targeting
miR-155 for anticancer drug discovery.
