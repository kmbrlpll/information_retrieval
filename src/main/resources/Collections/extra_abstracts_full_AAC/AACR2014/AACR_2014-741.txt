Title: Combined inhibition of MDM2 and MEK for KRAS mutant non-small cell
lung cancer


There are currently no effective targeted therapies for KRAS mutant
NSCLC. Combination drug strategies that target downstream pathways
activated by mutant KRAS are currently being investigated, however
efficacy may be limited by inability to induce a sufficient apoptotic
response. MDM-2 (murine double minute 2) is a ubiquitin ligase that
negatively regulates p53 function by promoting its degradation.
Inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction lead to p53 activation and
transcription of genes promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We
investigated the efficacy of combined MEK and MDM2 inhibition for KRAS
mutant NSCLC. In KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines with wild-type p53,
pimasertib (MEKi) and SAR405838 (MDM-2i) led to upregulation of BIM and
PUMA respectively. Induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest
correlated with in vitro efficacy, and the combination exhibited marked
in vivo activity against KRAS mutant p53 wild-type NSCLC xenograft
tumors. These studies provide rationale for future clinical investigation
of combined MEK and MDM-2 inhibition for KRAS mutant NSCLC.
