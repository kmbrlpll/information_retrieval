Title: Mammary cancer preventive activity of an extract of withania
somnifera roots


Mammary cancer preventive activity of an alcoholic extract of Withania
somnifera (WS) roots was examined in female ErbB2+/- (MMTV/Neu) mice. The
WS root extract was mixed with feed at a concentration of 750 mg/kg of
diet. Mice treated with the root extract developed fewer mammary tumors
relative to mice in the untreated group; after 310 days, mice in the
treated group had an average of 1.62 tumors, and mice in the control
group had 2.48, a reduction of 33% (p=0.1). Representative samples of the
mammary tumors were examined histologically after staining with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and for proliferation (Ki67 and PCNA). For
mammary tumors of control mice, sections stained with H&E showed high
mitotic activity, whereas in tumors from treated mice, there was low
mitotic activity. Labeling indices for Ki67 and PCNA markers in cancers
of treated mice were 35% and 30% lower, respectively, than those of the
control group. Expression of the cytokine CCL2 was 50% lower in cancers
of the treated group. These results indicate that the root extract of WS
reduces mammary tumor formation and tumor cell proliferation. Supported
