Title: The difference of serum RNA profile: RNA detection method


Serum miRNA profiles are widely reported by many research groups, but
they do not always coincide well. The reason of this difference is
suggested to be, at least in some cases, due to a difference in the
RNAdetection method. In this report, we compare the miRNA expression data
obtained by different detection tools.. In these days, the whole miRNA
expression profiling can be done by multiple qRT-PCR, microarrays, and
Next Generation Sequencing. However, the feature of each method will
reflect to the obtained data and it is no surprise that data obtained by
different tools do not match perfectly. We will compare the serum miRNA
expression profiles detected by (1) TaqMan Array MicroRNA Card (2) QIAGEN
miScript miRNA PCR Array (3) 3D-Gene Human miRNA oligo chip, (4)HiSeq
Next Generation Sequencer (5) Nanostring nCounter Analysis system and
discuss the base of method for serum miRNA profiling.
