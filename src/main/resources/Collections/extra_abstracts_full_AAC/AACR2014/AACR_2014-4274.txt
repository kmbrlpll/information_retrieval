Title: High fidelity copy number analysis of formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded tissues using Affymetrix CytoScan HD chip


Detection of human genome copy number variation (CNV) is one of the most
important analyses in diagnosing human malignancies. Genome CNV detection
in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues remains
challenging task. Here, we report that a modified method to analyze CNV
in FFPE tissues using Affymetrix Cytoscan HD chips. Our analysis showed a
91% overlap in CNV detection between FFPE and the karyotype analysis on 8
cases of lymphoma samples. The CNV overlap between frozen and the matched
FFPE tissues reached 93.8%. When the analyses were restricted to regions
containing genes, 87.1% concordance between FFPE and fresh frozen tissues
was found. The results suggest that the modified method using Affymetrix
Cytoscan HD chip represents a significant improvement over most of the
previous methods in terms of accuracy in detecting CNV in FFPE tissues.
This FFPE methodology may hold promise for wide application of CNV
analysis on clinical samples.
