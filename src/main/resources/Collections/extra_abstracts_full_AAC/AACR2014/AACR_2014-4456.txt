Title: Aurora-A is a downstream target of RAS and forms a positive
feedback regulation loop with NF-B in non-small cell lung cancer


Previous studies have shown that inhibition of Aurora-A reduces mutant
RAS oncogenic activity and that both Aurora-A and RAS activate NF-B
pathway through phosphorylation of IkBa and upregulation of GSKa,
respectively. Here we show that Aurora-A expression and kinase activity
are regulated by activating mutation of KRAS. Blockage of NF-B by
IB-S32/36A abrogated KRAS-induced Aurora-A expression and kinase
activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NF-B directly bound to
Aurora-A promoter and induces Aurora-A transcription. In addition,
depletion of Aurora-A by siRNA and pharmacological inhibitor MLN8237
suppresses RAS-induced NF-B activity and selectively induces cell death
in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. We also show that Aurora-A is induced by
nicotine and is frequently overexpressed in NSCLCs. Overexpression of
Aurora-A is associated with tobacco smoke and poor prognosis in lung
adenocarcinoma but not squamous lung cancer. These data suggest that
Aurora-A is regulated by RAS through NF-B and that the feedback
regulation loop between Aurora-A and NF-B could play a pivotal role in
NSCLC.
