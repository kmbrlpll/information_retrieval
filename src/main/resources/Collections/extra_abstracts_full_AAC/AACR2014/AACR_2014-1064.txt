Title: IL-6 secreted by tumor-associated macrophages promotes DLBCL
chemoresistance via expansion of the CSCs population


Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), a highly tumorigenic subpopulation of
cells found in developmentally diverse tumors, are highly resistant to
chemotherapeutic drugs. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are known to
promote progression of tumors and chemoresistance of DLBCL (Diffuse Large
B cell Lymphoma). Here, we report that TAMs promote a CSC-like phenotype
in DLBCL cells. This was characterized by increased ALDH1A1, Sox-2,
Oct-4, Nanog and KLF-4 gene expression. In in vitro studies, we found
that co-culture with monocyte cell lines enhanced the chemoresistance and
CSC-like phenotypes of DLBCL cells. RNA-seq revealed high levels of IL-6
expression following co-culture with DLBCL, and in fact IL-6 was
sufficient to promote the chemoresistance and CSC-like phenotypes of
DLBCL cells. Surprisingly, patients exhibited elevated IL-6 after
chemotherapy relative to patients pre-chemotherapy, suggesting that
chemotherapy may elicit a host response favoring chemoresistance. High
levels of serum IL-6 were associated with poor prognosis. In agreement
with these results, tumor infiltration by TAMs directly correlated with
disease severity. Therefore, IL-6 may be a prognostic marker for outcome
in DLBCL.
