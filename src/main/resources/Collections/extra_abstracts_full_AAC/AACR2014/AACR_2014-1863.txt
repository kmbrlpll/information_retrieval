Title: Androgen receptor CAG repeat length and TMPRSS2:ETS prostate
cancer risk: results from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial


Recent evidence suggests that genetic variations within the androgen
receptor (AR) may influence the formation of TMPRSS2:ETS gene fusions,
which are detected in more than half of all prostate cancers. We
investigated the association between the length of the polymorphic
trinucleotide CAG microsatellite repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene and
risk of prostate cancer containing these fusion genes. This nested
case-control study came from subjects enrolled in the Prostate Cancer
Prevention Trial and included 195 biopsy-proven prostate cancer cases
with known TMPRSS2:ETS status and 1344 matched controls. There was no
association between CAG repeat length and risk of TMPRSS2:ETS-positive
(OR=0.97, 95% CI, 0.91-1.04) or TMPRSS2:ETS-negative prostate cancer
(OR=1.04, 95% CI, 0.97-1.10) and in patients with low- or high-grade
disease. Our findings suggested that AR CAG repeats are not associated
with TMPRSS2:ETS formation in prostate cancer.
