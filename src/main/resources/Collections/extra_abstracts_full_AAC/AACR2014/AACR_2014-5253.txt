Title: PTEN represses oncogene expression by regulating Daxx-H3.3
deposition in the chromatin


One of the most mutated and deleted gene in cancer is the tumor
suppressor gene pten (phosphatase and tensin homology, deleted on
chromosome ten). To further understand how PTEN inactivation contributes
to cancer predisposition, we investigated how PTEN regulates gene
expression. We found that the histone chaperon protein Daxx (death
domain-associated protein) associates with PTEN, in vivo and in vitro,
and regulates PTEN stability through acetylation and ubiquitination. We
observed that PTEN regulates Histone 3.3 (H3.3 variant) loading in the
chromatin by limiting Daxx interactions, and thereby controls expression
of several tumor driver genes. Furthermore, when Daxx expression is
disrupted in pten-deficient glioma stem cells, we observed a dramatic
diminution of pluripotency transcription factors, a decrease in
differentiation and sphere-forming capacity, and an increase in radiation
sensitivity. In conclusion, this work supports a novel
chromatin-associated function for PTEN that regulates H3.3 deposition,
and gene expression, through Daxx interaction. This nominates Daxx as a
therapeutic target to treat patients with gliomas and other types of
cancers in which PTEN is mutated.
