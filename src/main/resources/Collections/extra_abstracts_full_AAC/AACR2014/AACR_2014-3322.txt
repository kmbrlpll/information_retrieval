Meeting: 2014 AACR Annual Meeting
Title: Spatio-temporal regulation of epithelial transformation by
mistrafficking of EGFR ligand, epiregulin


The EGF receptor (EGFR) ligand epiregulin (EREG) is delivered
preferentially to the basolateral cell surface of polarized MDCK cells.
Recently, we showed that EREG basolateral trafficking is regulated by a
conserved tyrosine residue within a YXX motif (Y156ERV) in its
cytoplasmic domain. Interestingly, a Y156A substitution led to apical
mistrafficking of EREG and transformation of polarized MDCK cells (PNAS
110: 8960-5, 2013). We have identified EREG mutations (R147stop) in human
tumors that would disrupt the basolateral sorting motif of EREG and now
report that EREG harboring these patient mutations mistrafficks to the
apical surface. We propose that ligand mistrafficking is a driver of
transformation rather than being a mere passenger. To test our proposal
wild-type and mutant EREG will be inducibly (Tet-ON) expressed at various
stages of MDCK cyst formation and maintenance in 3D Matrigel cultures
where we have now recapitulated the transformation phenotype induced by
EREG-mistrafficking. Results from these experiments will be presented at
the meeting.
