Title: Methylselenic acid inhibits the soluble and cell-surface bound
NKG2D-ligand ULBP2 in melanoma


The secretion of the soluble NKG2D-ligand ULBP2 is a marker for poor
prognosis in several types of cancer. NKG2D-ligands are normally directed
to the cell surface of stressed, inflamed or pre-cancer cells and serve
as targets for immune effector cells expressing the NKG2D receptor. The
soluble NKG2D-ligands are devastating due to their chronic activation and
thereby desensitization of NKG2D expressing immune effector cells. In
fact this leads to severely compromised immune activation governing
cancer development.The present study describes that methylselenic acid
(MSA) is able to inhibit soluble ULBP2 in different primary melanoma cell
lines. Moreover, MSA actively suppressed ULBP2 both from constitutively
expressing tumors and after induction by HDAC-inhibitors. In the attempt
to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition, real-time qPCR experiments were
performed. MSA activated the promoter and the transcription of the ULBP2
gene at a level similar to HDAC-inhibitors. These findings strongly
indicate that ULBP2 is post-transcriptional regulated.Selective blocking
of ULBP2 from melanomas or other cancers that produces soluble immune
suppressive ULBP2 is thus a new treatment strategy that also has the
potential to be used in combination with existing treatment regimens.
