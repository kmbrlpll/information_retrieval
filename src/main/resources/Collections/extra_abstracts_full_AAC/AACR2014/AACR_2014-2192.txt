Title: Defective calcium signaling pathway highlights the mutational
landscapes of liver metastasis from colorectal and breast cancer


Few therapeutic options are currently available to treat metastasis to
distant organs (e.g., liver) in colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer
(BC) patients. To gain insight into the genetic and molecular
underpinnings of metastasis, we performed whole-exome sequencing on
paired primary and metastasis samples from 5 CRC and 2 BC patients and
focused sequencing on additional 13-paired tumors to identify and
validate somatic genetic alterations. The results showed that the
mutational spectra of metastases were highly heterogeneous. Nevertheless,
genetic aberrations in calcium signaling pathway genes (GPR98, SYT6,
TACR3, CYSLTR1, RYR3, and CACNA1A) were somatically mutated in liver
metastases in 25% of CRC and BC cases, indicating that calcium-dependent
signaling plays a key role in distant metastasis. These results begin to
define the genetic basis underlying liver metastasis from CRC/BC and
identify potential therapeutic targets.
