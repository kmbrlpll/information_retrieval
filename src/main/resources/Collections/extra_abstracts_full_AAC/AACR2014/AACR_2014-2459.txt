Title: The oncogenic activity of MDMx is associated with physical
interaction and suppression of retinoblastoma protein


The aim of this study is to investigate the role of MDMx (or MDM4) on the
regulation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Inactivation of Rb plays a
critical role in the development of human malignancies. We have
previously shown that MDM2, an ubiquitin E3 ligase and a major negative
regulator of p53, binds to and promotes proteasome-mediated degradation
of Rb independent of p53. MDMX, a homolog of MDM2, also binds to and
inhibits p53 transactivation activity, yet it does not possess an
ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. In this study, we show that MDMX binds to
and promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of Rb in a MDM2-dependent
manner. The C-terminal Ring domain of MDMX binds to the Rb C-pocket and
enhances MDM2-Rb interaction. Knockdown of MDMX induces Rb protein
accumulation, cell cycle G1 arrest, and premature cellular senescence,
which can be reverted by simultaneous knockdown of Rb. Furthermore,
ablation of MDMX significantly suppresses tumor growth, concomitant with
Rb accumulation, in an animal xenograft model. Together, these results
demonstrate that MDMX possesses oncogenic activity associated with
suppression of Rb and suggest that both MDM2 and MDMX can be targets for
cancer therapy.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.
