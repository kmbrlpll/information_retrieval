Title: BEX protein attenuates the mitotic checkpoint and induces
preneoplastic aneuploidy


The mitotic checkpoint plays a critical role in preventing chromosome
missegregation and the adaptation of aneuploid cells. BubR1 kinase is a
member of the mitotic checkpoint machinery. To understand the function of
BubR1-mediated mitotic checkpoint, we have screened a novel
BubR1-interating protein, BEX, by performing yeast two-hybrid systems.
Here, we show that overexpression of BEX protein with sustained spindle
poison results in a production of aneuploid cells and less apoptotic cell
death. Inhibition of BubR1 expression increases aneuploid cell
populations, whereas knockdown of both BEX and BubR1 avoid polyploidy by
undergoing apoptosis in BubR1-depleted aneuploid cells. In addition,
forced BEX expression significantly induces the colony forming potential
and accelerates the proliferation rate. Interestingly, BEX is localized
on X chromosome, and seems to be selectively expressed at cancer cells
and tissues. These results indicate that BEX expression leads to mitotic
dysfunction, and contributes to unstable chromosome aneuploid cells to be
preneoplastically adapted.
