Title: Structure-activity relationship studies for PSMA-targeted
tubulysin conjugates


Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a cell-surface receptor
expressed on prostate cancer cells. Recent findings suggest that PSMA is
also abundant on newly formed blood vessels which supply most
non-prostatic solid tumors; including lung, colon, breast, renal, liver,
and pancreatic carcinomas. These reports have provided solid support for
the concept of designing drug conjugates for PSMA-targeted cancer
therapy. Here we describe our structure-activity relationship analyses
resulting in the discovery of highly potent PSMA-targeted tubulysin
conjugates. In our study, more than thirty ligand-drug constructs were
designed and synthesized based on strategically placing a variety of
chemical groups responsible for evoking a targeted biological effect in
vitro and in vivo. The optimized molecular architecture is comprised of a
high affinity PSMA-binding urea-type ligand, a water soluble peptide- or
carbohydrate-based spacer unit, a cleavable disulfide-containing
self-immolative linker system, and the highly potent chemotherapy drug
tubulysin which inhibits microtubule activity . One of the conjugates
possessed superior targeted activity and was selected for further
preclinical development.
