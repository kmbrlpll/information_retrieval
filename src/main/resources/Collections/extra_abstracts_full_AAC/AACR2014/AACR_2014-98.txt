Title: A novel mouse model for intestinal serrated polyposis


Serrated polyps have recently been proposed to comprise at least 30% of
the origins of human colorectal cancer (CRC). Unlike adenomatous polyps,
which are initiated by APC/-catenin mutations, the genetic and molecular
mechanisms underlying the serrated pathway that leads to serrated polyp
initiation and progression remain poorly understood.Here we describe a
novel genetically modified mouse model of serrated polyposis via
conditional activation of SMAD7, an inhibitory SMAD protein, in the
intestinal epithelia. We show that SMAD7 activation is sufficient to
drive serrated polyp initiation and progression to aggressive
adenocarcinoma in both mouse intestine and colon. Mechanistically, we
find that SMAD7-induced foci formation in non-transformed intestinal
epithelial cells in vitro and serrated polyposis in vivo are Wnt/-catenin
independent. Furthermore, we find that, in addition to its regulation of
TGF/BMP pathway, SMAD7 interacts with BRAF/MAPK signaling to regulate
serrated polyposis. Taken together, our studies implicate for the first
time the involvement of SMAD7 in serrated polyposis and reveal a
potential novel molecular mechanism underlying the serrated polyp pathway.
