Title: The CendR pathway: A novel cell penetration and transcytosis
pathway regulated by nutrient availability


Transport of molecules across the vascular wall, through tissue, and into
target cells plays an important role in various physiological and
pathological processes. We previously described a novel class of
tumor-targeting peptides (CendR peptides) that penetrate into cells and
tumor tissue through an as yet incompletely characterized transport
pathway initiated by peptide binding to neuropilin-1 (NRP1). This pathway
has shown promise in enhancing drug delivery into tumors. Here we perform
a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify components responsible for cell
penetration of CendR peptides. We show that the binding of CendR peptides
to NRP1 initiates a novel endocytic process that depends on a subset of
genes and a transport route distinct from those of known endocytic
pathways. Strikingly, we found the internalization of CendR peptides to
be controlled by nutrient-sensing and cell growth-regulatory pathways.
Nutrient deprivation stimulated the cell penetration and intercellular
transport of CendR peptides, both in vitro and in vivo. These data
suggest a physiological role for CendR pathway in nutrient sensing and
transport. The ability to activate this pathway with peptides provides
immediate applications to drug delivery.
