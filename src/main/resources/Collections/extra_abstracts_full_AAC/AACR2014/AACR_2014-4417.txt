Title: Targeting Ras with small molecules that activate SOS-mediated
nucleotide exchange


Aberrant activation of Ras, by mutation or constitutively active upstream
kinases, occurs in nearly 30% of all human cancers, rendering Ras one of
the most validated targets in cancer drug discovery. Historically, the
direct inhibition of Ras with small molecules has proven extremely
difficult. Here we report the discovery of compounds that bind to a
unique pocket on the Ras:SOS:Ras complex, which increase the rate of
SOScat-catalyzed nucleotide exchange in vitro and modulate Ras signaling
pathways in cells. X-ray crystallography reveals that the molecules bind
in a hydrophobic pocket in the CDC25 domain of SOS, adjacent to the
Switch II region of Ras. Structure-based mutational analyses confirmed
the functional relevance of this binding site and demonstrated that it is
essential for compound activity. Consistent with their increased exchange
activity in vitro, these molecules increase Ras-GTP levels in cells.
However, the compounds inhibit ERK and AKT phosphorylation; the ERK
inhibition at high concentrations is accompanied by an increase of p-ERK
levels at lower compound concentrations. These molecules represent a
unique tool to study the acute activation of Ras and highlight a novel
pocket on SOS that may be exploited to modulate Ras signaling.
