Title: Genome-wide association study of survival in early stage non-small
cell lung cancer


Lung cancer, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is the
leading cause of cancer-related deaths all over the world. Studies have
indicated that molecular biomarkers including genetic variants may
provide additional values for the targeted treatments and clinical
outcomes of NSCLC patients. In this study, we evaluated the associations
between genome-wide genetic variants and the survival of NSCLC in a
cohort of 365 early-stage NSCLC patients with surgery, and replicated
sixteen promising loci in another independent cohort with 327 early-stage
NSCLC patients in Chinese population. The results showed that rs10023113
in CAMK2D was consistently associated with survival of early-stage NSCLC
in the GWAS scan and the replication cohort [GWAS scan: hazard ratio (HR)
= 2.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.90-4.23, P = 1.2910-6;
replication cohort: HR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.15-4.21, P = 1.8010-2]. When
combining all the patients, the results showed that the variant allele of
rs10023113 was significantly associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC with
P value reaching 3.4010-7 (HR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.67-3.17). These findings
suggest that CAMK2D rs10023113 may be a potentially prognostic marker for
overall survival of early-stage NSCLC patients in Chinese population.
