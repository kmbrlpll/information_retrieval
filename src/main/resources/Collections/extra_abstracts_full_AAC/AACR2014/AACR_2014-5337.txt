Title: Molecular dynamics study on keap1 point mutations in lung cancer


Keap1 is a BTB-Kelch substrate adaptor protein that regulates
steady-state levels of Nrf2, a bZIP transcription factor, in response to
oxidative stress. In basal condition, Nrf2 is negatively regulated
through ubiquitination by Keap1. However, upon exposure to oxidative
stress, ubiquitination of Nrf2 is inhibited, resulting increased
steady-state level of Nrf2 and increased transcription of cytoprotective
ARE (antioxidant response elements)-dependent genes. Reported in 2006,
the structure of Keap1 Kelch domain in complex with a 16-mer peptide
derived from Nrf2 has been solved by X-ray crystallography to a
resolution of 1.85. Accordingly, it grants us a chance to evaluate the
interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2 and further interpret numerous
experimental findings on unbinding due to modifications on Keap1. Herein
we apply molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding behaviors of
Keap1 and Nrf2 based on the solved structure to investigate how single
point mutations G364C and G430C on Keap1 affect Keap1-Nrf2 binding and
further cause lung cancer.Note: This abstract was not presented at the
meeting.
