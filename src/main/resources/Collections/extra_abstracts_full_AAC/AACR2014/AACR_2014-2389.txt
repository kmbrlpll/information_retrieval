Title: PTEN localizes to the nucleus and interacts with Rad52 in response
to DNA damage


PTEN is a tumor suppressor with a dual phosphatase activity. Mutations of
PTEN gene has been associated with many sporadic cancers and heritable
neoplastic syndromes. PTEN also exhibits nuclear localization. However,
the exact function of nuclear PTEN remains unclear. Here we show that
PTEN exhibits a time-dependent nuclear translocation after DNA damage,
co-localizing with DNA damage foci on chromatin, and that the nuclear
translocation of PTEN is closely associated with its phosphorylation on
S366/T370. Deletional analysis reveals that C2 domain of PTEN is
responsible for its nuclear translocation after exposure to genotoxin.
Both casein kinase 2 and GSK3 are involved in the phosphorylation of
S366/T370, as well as PTEN's association with chromatin during DNA damage
response. Significantly, PTEN specifically interacts with Rad52 and
positively regulates its sumoylation. Taken together, these observations
strongly suggest that PTEN may mediate DNA damage repair through
interacting with and regulating Rad52 in the nucleus.
