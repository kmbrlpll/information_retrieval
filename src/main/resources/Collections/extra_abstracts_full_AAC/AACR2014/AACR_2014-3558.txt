Title: The role of miRNA in PAX3-FKHR positive rhabdomyosarcoma


Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most commonly diagnosed pediatric soft tissue
cancer. Tumors may develop in several locations, but all tumors express
markers of undifferentiated skeletal muscle tissue. Of the two main
rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes, the alveolar subtype leads to a much poorer
prognosis than the embryonal subtype. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is
characterized by a chromosomal translocation between either chromosomes 1
and 13, or more commonly 2 and 13, which creates the fusion genes
PAX7-FKHR or PAX3-FKHR, respectively. The fusion genes encode a protein
that contains the PAX DNA binding domain and the FKHR transactivation
domain, but the mechanism of disease of the fusion protein has not yet
been fully elucidated. Here we use gain of function and loss of function
techniques to study the effect of PAX3-FKHR on miRNA expression. Using
small RNA-seq, we show that PAX3-FKHR expression leads to an upregulation
of microRNAs mir-495 and miR-543. Examination of the mir-495 and mir-543
genes revealed conserved PAX3 binding sites. We further investigate the
effect of the microRNAs on rhabdomyosarcoma cell differentiation and
tumorigenicity.
