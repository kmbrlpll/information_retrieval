Title: Progesterone generates breast cancer stem cells through nuclear
receptor-independent mechanisms in irradiated human mammary cell lines


Epidemiological evidence has shown the existence of increased breast
cancer risk following chest radiation exposure. There is strong evidence
that steroid hormones influence radiosensitivity and breast cancer risk.
Tumors may be initiated by a small subpopulation of cancer stem cells
(CSCs). In order to evaluate whether the modulation of radiation-induced
breast cancer risk by steroid hormones could involve CSCs, we measured
the proportion of ALDH+ and CD44+/CD24- CSCs in irradiated breast cancer
cell lines after progesterone and estrogen treatment. Progesterone
stimulated the expansion of the CSC compartment both in progesterone
receptor (PR)-positive breast cancer cells and in PR-negative normal
cells. In MCF10A normal epithelial PR-negative cells,
progesterone-treatment and irradiation triggered cancer and
stemness-associated microRNA regulations (such as the down-regulation of
miR-22 and miR-29c expression), which resulted in increased proportions
of radiation-resistant tumor-initiating CSCs. Therefore progesterone
might influence radiation-induced breast cancer risk by generating
tumor-initiating breast CSCs through nuclear PR-independent mechanisms
(such as membrane progesterone receptors - mPRs).
