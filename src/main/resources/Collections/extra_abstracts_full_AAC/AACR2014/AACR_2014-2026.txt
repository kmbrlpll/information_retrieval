Title: Analysis of the impact of compounds derived from marine organisms
on 3D co-spheroids generated from multiple myeloma cells and stromal cell
types


Multiple myeloma (MM) is a severe leukemic disease of plasma B-cells in
the bone marrow to which there is currently no cure. Stromal components
such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) or endothelial cells (EC) are
suspected to play a central role in mediating resistance during treatment
of patients. In the attempt to identify novel drugs for the treatment of
MM in extracts of marine organisms, we established 3D co-spheroid systems
which would allow to factor in micro-environmental signals already in the
early phase of drug discovery. We report on the establishment of both an
angiogenesis and a proliferation assay using 3D co-spheroids combining MM
cells together with either endothelial or mesenchymal stromal cells,
respectively. These co-spheroid systems were applied to characterize a
variety of compounds for their anti-angiogenic activity on EC or
anti-proliferative activity on MM as well as MSC.Funded by European Union
