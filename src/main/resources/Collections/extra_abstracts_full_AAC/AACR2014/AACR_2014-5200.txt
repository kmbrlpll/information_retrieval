Title: MicroRNA-634 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis by targeting
anti-apopotic and mitochondria-related genes in human cancer cells


MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs composed of 2025
base pairs that can negatively regulate gene expression by interfering
with the translation of target transcripts. Since it has been known that
some miRNAs function as tumor suppressors (TS) and their expression
levels are often down-regulated in cancer, TS-miRNAs are expected to be
therapeutic agents for cancer therapy. Thus, we conducted function-based
screening using a miRNA library, and identified several TS-miRNAs,
including miR-152, miR-218, miR-596.Recently, we identified miR-634 as a
new TS-miRNA, which induced cell death with mitochondrial dysfunction and
caspase activation. The expression analysis and the target-prediction
program revealed miR-634 might directly target genes related with
anti-apoptosis and mitochondrial function.Importantly, this miRNA was
frequently down-regulated in primary tumor samples of esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC), compared with that in corresponding normal
tissues. Furthermore, the combination therapy of miR-634 and cisplatin
was effective to ESCC cell line in vitro and in vivo. Thus, these
findings suggest that miR-634 may be useful as a potential therapeutic
agent of ESCC.
