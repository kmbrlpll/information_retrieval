Title: Wnt/-catenin signaling mediates the anti-tumor activity of three
ginsenoside derivatives in lung cancer


In previous publication, the anti-tumor activity of
25-hydroxyprotopanaxadiol (25-OH-PPD), a natural compound isolated from
fruits of Panax ginseng, has been studied. In the current study, we
investigated the anti-tumor activity of three derivatives synthesized
from 25-OH-PPD, namely xl, 1c, and 8b, respectively. All three compounds
significantly inhibited the growth of human lung cancer cells in vitro,
while having lesser effect on the growth of normal primary muscle cells.
In vivo, oral administration of three compounds could significantly
inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors without affecting body weight.
Further mechanistic study demonstrated that these compounds could
decrease the expression levels of -catenin and its downstream targets
Cyclin D1, CDK4, and c-myc in A549 cells. Taken together, the results
suggested that the anti-tumor activity exerted by these 25-OH-PPD
derivatives is partially through -catenin mediated signaling pathway in
lung cancer cells, a finding that could potentially translate into a
chemotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung cancer.Note: This
abstract was not presented at the meeting.
