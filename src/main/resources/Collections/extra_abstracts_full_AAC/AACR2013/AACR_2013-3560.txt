Title: The chromatin architecture at gucocorticoid receptor binding sites.


Steroid hormone receptors are transcription factors that are implicated
in the development and progression of several cancer types. It is clear
that receptor activity is deregulated in these disease states. Using the
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a model factor for transcriptional
initiation, we aimed to understand the role chromatin structure plays in
defining the specific genetic programs initiated by receptor activation.
Using Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE), we
examined the chromatin state at GR binding locations. FAIRE-seq data
indicated an enrichment of signal, suggesting a more open chromatin
state, surrounding the GR binding sites even in the absence of hormone.
This enrichment is only seen at binding sites and not at unutilized
response elements. This data is in line with recent developments
indicating accessibility as a determinant of receptor binding. However,
further characterization of binding regions suggests consistent
nucleosome occupancy at these binding locations. Taken together, these
data suggest that receptor binding may be determined by a very specific
chromatin architecture that is defined by a transitional accessibility
state.
