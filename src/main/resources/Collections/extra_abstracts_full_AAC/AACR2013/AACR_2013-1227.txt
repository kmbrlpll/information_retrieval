Title: Macrophage depletion enhances the anticancer efficacy of eribulin
mesylate in mice bearing syngeneic tumors.


Recent reports utilizing the MMTV-PyMT spontaneous model of breast cancer
established that inhibition of macrophage recruitment to the tumors
resulted in increased anti-cancer activity of paclitaxel. Eribulin
mesylate (Halaven) is a non-taxane microtubule-dynamics inhibitor
recently approved for third line clinical use in patients with heavily
pretreated metastatic breast cancer, based upon a statistically
significant increase in median overall survival (OS) compared to
treatment of physician's choice. In the present study we investigated
whether systemic depletion of macrophages would enhance eribulin
anti-tumor efficacy. In the subcutaneous Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)
syngeneic murine tumor model, we found that macrophage depletion via
liposomal clodronate enhanced eribulin inhibition of tumor growth.
Current studies are investigating the mechanism(s) of this activity.
