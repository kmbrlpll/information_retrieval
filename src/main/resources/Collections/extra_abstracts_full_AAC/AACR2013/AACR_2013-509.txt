Title: RNF115/BCA2 E3 ubiquitin ligase promotes breast cancer cell
proliferation through targeting p21Waf1/Cip1 for ubiquitin-mediated
degradation .


The E3 ubiquitin ligase Ring Finger Protein 115 (RNF115), also known as
Breast Cancer Associated gene 2 (BCA2), has previously been reported to
be overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast tumors and to
promote breast cell proliferation; however, the mechanism is unknown. In
this study, we demonstrated that silencing of BCA2 by siRNA in two
ER-positive breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D decreases cell
proliferation and increases the protein levels of the cyclin-dependent
kinases inhibitor p21Waf/Cip1. The protein stability of p21 was
negatively regulated by BCA2. BCA2 directly interacts with p21 and
promotes p21 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of p21
partially rescues the cell growth arrest induced by the BCA2 siRNA. These
results suggest that BCA2 promotes ER-positive breast cancer cell
proliferation at least partially through down-regulating the expression
of p21.This study was supported by National Nature Science Foundation of
