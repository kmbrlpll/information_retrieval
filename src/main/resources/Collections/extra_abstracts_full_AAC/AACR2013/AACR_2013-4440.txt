Title: Identification and characterization of small molecule inhibitors
that radiosensitize K-RAS mutant rectal cancers.


Around 40% of rectal cancers harbor activating K-RAS mutations, and these
mutations are associated with resistance to chemoradiotherapy. We aimed
to identify small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) that synergize with ionizing
radiation (IR) (radiosensitizers) that could be incorporated into current
treatment strategies for K-RAS mutant locally advanced rectal cancer
(LARC) patients. We first optimized a high-throughput assay for measuring
individual and combined effects of SMIs and IR that produces similar
results to the gold standard colony formation assay. Using this screening
platform and K-RAS mutant rectal cancer cell lines, we tested SMIs
targeting diverse signaling pathways for radiosensitizing activity and
then evaluated our top hits in follow-up experiments. The two most potent
radiosensitizers were the Chk1/2 inhibitor AZD7762 and the PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor BEZ235. The chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which
is used to treat LARC, synergized with AZD7762 and enhanced
radiosensitization by AZD7762 but not by BEZ235. This study is the first
to compare different SMIs in combination with IR for the treatment of
K-RAS mutant rectal cancer, and our findings suggest that Chk1/2
inhibitors should be evaluated in new clinical trials for LARC.
