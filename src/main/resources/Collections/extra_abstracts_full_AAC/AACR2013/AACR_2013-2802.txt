Title: Salmonella typhimurium A1-R inhibits brain metastasis in an
orthotropic breast cancer nude-mouse model.


We have previously developed tumor-targeting Salmonella typhimurium A1-R
(A1-R), which has shown efficacy against multiple cancer types in nude
mouse models. In this study, we demonstrated that S. typhimurium A1-R can
inhibit and eradicate brain metastasis in an orthotopic metastatic BALB/c
mouse model of breast cancer. To establish the model, 4T1 breast cancer
cells expressing RFP (5.0 106/100 L) in 100 l serum-free solution were
injected slowly into the right second mammary gland. Two weeks after
cells implantation, the primary tumors were removed. Approximately 30% of
post-surgery nude mice were found with brain metastasis using
fluorescence imaging 4-5 weeks after injection of 4T1-RFP cells. When the
mice were found with brain metastasis, S. typhimurium A1-R [5107 CFU/100
l] was injected into the tail vein once a week for 3 weeks. Inhibition of
brain metastatic growth was observed noninvasively by the Maestro
fluorescence imaging system (Perkin-Elmer Inc.) compared with untreated
mice. Intravenous administration of S. typhimurium A1-R improved survival
70%. This study shows the important potential of bacterial therapy of
brain metastasis.
