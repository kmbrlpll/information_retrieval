Title: Synergistic effects of CG200745 combining with Gemcitabine and/or
Erotinib in pancreatic cancer.


CG200745 is a HDAC inhibitor at the final stage of phase I clinical
trial. In the current human studies with patient with terminal solid
tumors, CG200745 is showing highly desirable PK and safety profiles.
Actually, the AUC/dose of CG200745 is the highest among all the clinical
stage HDAC inhibitors. CG200745 is more distributed in tumor tissue that
in plasma. Moreover, SD's (stable disease) were observed even in single
dose study. Currently, we are planning phase II studies using regimens
combining CG200745 and existing therapy in patients with solid tumors. As
a choice of indications, pancreatic cancer was considered based on
biological studies and observation in phase I clinical studies.Thus,
cellular and xenograft studies of CG200745 using pancreatic cancer cell
lines have been carried out in our laboratories. In these studies,
treatments of CG200745 combining with gemcitabine and/or erotinib show
clear synergistic effects. These results indicate that the combination of
CG200745 with existing therapy can be a promising intervention for
pancreatic cancer.
