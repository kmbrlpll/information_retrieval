Title: TRAF2 is a key mediator of the EGF-induced signaling pathway.


TRAF2 plays a critical role in the mediation of the TNF-R signaling
pathway toward activation of NF-B and JNKs. Here, we reveal a novel
function of TRAF2 in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling pathway.
Knockdown of TRAF2 blocked EGF-induced AP-1 activity and
anchorage-independent cell transformation. We also showed that TRAF2 is
required for RSK2 activity through RSK2 ubiquitination and that RSK2
plays a critical role in AP-1 activity mediated through CREB/c-Fos, which
regulate anchorage-independent cell transformation.
