Title: Real-time imaging demonstrates cancer cells exposed to UV
irradiation either repair their DNA or die.


The DNA repair protein 53BP1 is re-localized in foci after DNA damage. In
this study, we imaged the real-time response of 53BP1 linked to GFP to
DNA damage induced by UV irradiation. Inhibition of proliferation by UV
irradiation was analyzed by a clonogenic assay. The relocalization of GFP
fused to the chromatin-binding domain of 53BP1 was imaged after UV
irradiation of MiaPaca-2 53BP1-GFP human pancreatic cancer cells. The
clonogenic assay demonstrated that UVC dose-dependently inhibited cell
proliferation, while UVA and UVB showed little effect. During live-cell
imaging, 53BP1-GFP foci formation was observed within 30 min after UVC
irradiation. High-dose UVC also induced apoptosis within 24 h after
irradiation. The cells treated with UVC irradiation appear to have two
different fates: DNA repair or apoptosis. A fraction of the cells
underwent apoptosis, and the other fraction repaired their DNA as
evidenced by 53BP1 focus formation. The present study demonstrates that
some cells may repair their DNA successfully and others can not. This has
important implication for UV-based photodynamic therapy.
