Title: Salmonella typhimurium A1-R targets quiescent cancer cells.


Quiescent cancer cells are resistant to cytotoxic agents which target
only proliferating cancer cells. The cell-cycle phase of each cancer cell
in real time was imaged using a fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle
indicator (FUCCI). With FUCCI, quiescent cancer cells express
mKusabira-Orange fluorescent protein (red) and proliferating cells
express mAzami-Green fluorescent protein (green). FUCCI-labeled cancer
cells in monolayer culture and tumor spheres were treated with Salmonella
typhimurium A1-R. Time-lapse confocal imaging showed that A1-R encircled
and invaded quiescent cancer cells in monolayer culture, thereby
eliminating them. Cancer cells in tumor spheres in serum-free culture
become and remain quiescent. A1-R infected and killed quiescent cancer
cells in tumor spheres. In contrast, cytotoxic agents did not kill
quiescent cancer cells in tumor spheres. A1-R infection of
FUCCI-expressing subcutaneous tumors growing in nude mice resulted in
killing quiescent cancer cells resistant to cytotoxic agents. This study
demonstrates that A1-R can kill quiescent cancer cells and suggests a new
therapeutic paradigm potentially more effective than current therapeutics
which are ineffective against quiescent cancer cells.
