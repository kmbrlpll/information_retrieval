Title: Differential gene expression profiles of FFPE samples with
SensationPlus and GeneChip arrays.


Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples represent a
largely untapped wealth of information on the transcriptional states of
clinically archived materials for retrospective studies. Although the RNA
is degraded during fixation and storage and has been considered unusable,
Affymetrix has developed SensationPlus, a target-preparation method that
allows transcriptional profiling from 20 ng of FFPE total RNA using
GeneChip arrays. We will demonstrate that SensationPlus expression
profiles from decade old FFPE materials are extremely similar to data
from their matched fresh frozen (FF) RNA counterparts.
