Title: E-FABP protects host from tumor development.


Epidermal fatty acid-binding protein (E-FABP) is constitutively expressed
in many immune cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages and T
lymphocytes. However, the role of E-FABP in host immunity against tumor
and cancer development is unknown. We hypothesize that E-FABP plays an
essential role in host immune responses to ward off tumor challenges.
Here we utilize a murine breast cancer model and E-FABP knockout mice to
study the function of E-FABP in host immune responses to tumor
challenges. It is found that implanted breast cancer cells develops much
faster into tumor in E-FABP knockout mice than in wild type ones. It is
also discovered that, when compared to wild type mice, F4/80+CD11c+
macrophages in tumor stroma from E-FABP knockout mice show a defective
protective immune response to breast cancer cells. Moreover, tumors in
E-FABP knockout mice contained much lower numbers of NK cells, CD8+ and
CD4+ T cells than those in WT mice. All these results suggest E-FABP
protects host from tumor development, implicating a significant role of
E-FABP in host immunity against tumor formation.
