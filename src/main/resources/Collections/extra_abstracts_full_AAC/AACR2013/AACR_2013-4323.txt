Title: Antibodies against TfR inhibit growth of tumor cells both in vitro
and in vivo.


Transferrin receptor (TfR) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein
regulating intracellular uptake of iron, and is therefore involved in
cell survival and proliferation. TfR has been reported to be more
abundantly expressed in dividing cells, e.g. malignant cells, than in
quiescent cells, as in most normal cells. Therefore, it is regarded as a
potential target for usage in cancer therapy. In the present study, we
generated a panel of human anti-TfR antibodies and evaluated its
anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo. We found that several
antibodies inhibited cell proliferation in various tumor cells, and
elicited antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. Among
these antibodies, PPMXT001 and PPMXT002 exerted a significant anti-tumor
activity in several xenograft models. PPMXT001 completely suppressed
tumor growth in a pancreatic cancer model (MIAPaCa2). PPMXT002 also
inhibited tumor growth by 6080% in several solid cancer xenograft models
including bladder cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic
cancer. These findings showed that PPMXT001 and PPMXT002 could be potent
candidates for developing antibody therapeutics to treat cancer.
