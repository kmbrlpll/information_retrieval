Title: HoxA10 gene expression profile correlates with tumorigenic
potential of medulloblastoma cell lines.


HOX genes are a family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors
defined as master genes of development, altered in cancer cells and thus
having implications for tumorigenesis. Developmental genes have been
recognized as one of the keys to understanding the tumor progression in
some type of cancers. This study aimed to correlate gene expression
profile of some HOX genes with the tumorigenic potential of
medulloblastoma cell lines (MCL).We used three human MCL, the UW473,
UW472 and DAOY and two human cerebellum primary cultures (CPC). The MCL
and CPC were characterized morphologically by light microscopy and
immunophenotypically by flow cytometry. MCL were assessed by tumorigenic
potential infusing 3x106 cells subcutaneously in NUDE mice. MCL and CPC
were evaluated for gene expression profile of HOXA3, HOXA10, HOXB3, HOXB4
and HOXB6 genes by quantitative real time PCR.MCL are morphologically
heterogeneous (polygonal and fibroblastoid morphology) and the CPC
present fibroblastoid morphology. Immunophenotypically, MCL and CPC were
similar for some CD markers and showed a high percentage (70-99%) for
CD44, CD73, CD105, CD166 and CD29 and low or absence (0-5.3%) for CD144,
CD31, CD34, CD45 and CD133. Some differences were observed for CD140b
(0.280.11%; 6.28.3%; 0.781.1%; 0.44%), CD24 (52.51.7%; 64.66.4%;
20.56.4%; 1.9%), CD146 (60.48.8%; 90.63.8%; 34.612%; 98.4%), CD73
(77.26.9%; 81.48.98%; 52,9712.4%; 99.1%), CD271 (3.33.7%; 26.916.22%;

UW473 and DAOY MCL, and CPC respectively. Regarding to tumorigenic
potential, among the UW402, UW473 and DAOY MCL, only the DAOY cell line
gave rise to tumor nodules that presented histology features similar to
medulloblastoma. About gene expression, the HOXA3 gene was 4,027.7430.9,
283.13.8 and 1.40.8 times higher expressed in DAOY, UW473 and UW402 MCL
respectively when compared to CPC (pHOX genes are a family of

this study demonstrates that MCL are morphologically heterogeneous and
CPC present fibroblastoid morphology. MCL and CPC showed an
immunophenotype somewhat different for some markers and DAOY cell line
was the only one that gave rise to tumor nodules in NUDE mice.
Correlating the tumorigenic potential with HOX gene expression level, the
HOXA10 is strongly expressed in DAOY tumorigenic cell line and low
expressed in UW402 and UW473 cell lines, suggesting that HOXA10 gene can
be related to tumor development in medulloblastoma.
