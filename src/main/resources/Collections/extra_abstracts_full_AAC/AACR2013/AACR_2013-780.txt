Title: Knockdown of p53 increases tumorigenicity of human breast cancer
cells.


The tumor suppressor p53 is mutated or functionally inactivated in 70%
cancer. p53 causes cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence, or induces
apoptosis in response to stress. Although knockdown of p53 has been shown
to increase tumorigenicity of human colon and lung cancer cells, it is
not known whether knockdown of p53 in human breast cancer cells can
indeed lead to increased tumorigenicity. We show that knockdown of p53 in
human breast cancer cells significantly increases tumorigenicity in vivo
and colony formation on soft agar in vitro. Our ongoing studies are
elucidating the underlying mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study demonstrating that knockdown of p53 increases
tumorigenicity of human breast cancer cells. Our results highlight the
importance of the tumor suppressor p53 in human breast cancer.Citation
