Title: Role of CRD-BP in the pathogenesis of human basal cell carcinoma.


Although the number of new cases of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) has
increased rapidly each year in the last few decades, the molecular basis
of its pathogenesis is not completely understood. Activation of Hedgehog
(Hh) signaling pathway was shown to be a key factor driving the
development of BCC. The Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway was also shown to
be activated in BCCs and to perhaps modulate the activity of Hh pathway.
We previously identified a novel mechanism by which Wnt signaling
regulates the transcriptional outcome of Hh signaling pathway. We
demonstrated that CRD-BP, a direct target of the Wnt/-catenin signaling,
induces the expression and transcriptional activity of the Hh
transcriptional activator GLI1. We hypothesized that Wnt-induced and
CRD-BP-dependent regulation of GLI1 expression and activities is
important to the development of BCC. In this study, the role of CRD-BP in
the development of human BCC will be discussed.
