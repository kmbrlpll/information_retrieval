Title: Residual embryonic cells as precursors of a Barrett's-like
metaplasia.


Barrett's esophagus is an intestine-like metaplasia and precursor of
esophageal adenocarcinoma. Trig- gered by gastroesophageal reflux
disease, the origin of this metaplasia remains unknown. p63-deficient
mice, which lack squamous epithelia, may model acid-reflux damage. We
show here that p63 null embryos rapidly develop intestine-like metaplasia
with gene expression profiles similar to Barrett's metaplasia. We track
its source to a unique embry- onic epithelium that is normally undermined
and re- placed by p63-expressing cells. Significantly, we show that a
discrete population of these embryonic cells persists in adult mice and
humans at the squa- mocolumnar junction, the source of Barrett's meta-
plasia. We show that upon programmed damage to the squamous epithelium,
these embryonic cells migrate toward adjacent, specialized squamous cells
in a process that may recapitulate early Barrett's. Our findings suggest
that certain precancerous lesions, such as Barrett's, initiate not from
genetic alterations but from competitive interactions between cell
lineages driven by opportunity.
