Title: Synthesis and characterization of PEGylated chlorin e6 sensitizers
for the photodynamic killing of human ovarian cancer cells.


Pegylated chlorin e6 photosensitizers have been synthesized with
triethylene glycol attached at the ester bond(s) for a 1:1 conjugate, a
2:1 conjugate, and a 3:1 conjugate. These chlorin sensitizers were
studied for hydrolytic stability and solubility. Our studies included an
analysis of ovarian OVCAR-5 cancer cell uptake, localization, and
phototoxicity. Because of our interest in fiber-based photosensitizer and
singlet oxygen delivery methods, desirable aspects of the 3:1 chlorin e6
conjugate make it a potential sensitizer for incorporation into a fiber
optic device, particularly in the area of ovarian cancer photodynamic
therapy.
