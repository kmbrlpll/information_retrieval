Title: Imaging exosome transfer from colon cancer cells to stroma at
liver metastatic sites in nude mouse.


Exosomes play an important role in cell-to-cell communication to promote
tumor metastasis. In order to image the fate of cancer-cell-derived
exosomes in liver metastasis of colon cancer, we used green fluorescent
protein (GFP)-tagged CD63, which is a general marker of exosomes.
GFP-exosome producing RFP human colon cancer HCT cells (HCT-RFP/GFP- Exo
cells) were injected in the spleen of nude mice. By day 28,
HCT-RFP/GFP-Exo cells were visualized in the liver with the Olympus OV100
imaging system. HCT-RFP/GFP- Exo cells secrete GFP-exosomes in the liver
metastasis site as observed with the Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope.
Colon cancer cells secreted exosomes into the tumor microenvironment.
Tumor-derived exosomes were incorporated into tumor-associated cells as
well as circulating in the blood of mice with colon cancer metastases.
These results suggest that tumor-derived exosomes may contribute to
forming a niche to promote tumor growth and metastasis. Our results
demonstrate the usefulness of GFP imaging to investigate the role of
exosomes in colon cancer liver metastasis.
