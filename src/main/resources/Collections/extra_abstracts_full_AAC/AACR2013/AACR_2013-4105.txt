Title: Signaling network-based analyses of sonic hedgehog pathway
components: predictions and possibilities.


A subclass of Medulloblastoma shows considerable dependence on the Sonic
Hedgehog (Shh) pathway. Since cellular functions are a consequence of
coordinated networks involving protein-protein interactions, it is
imperative to explore different events cooperating with Shh entities in
order to explore novel targets for medulloblastoma therapy. The Yes
Associated Protein (YAP), a component of the Hippo pathway, has been
previously established as a downstream target of the Shh pathway
(Fernandez et al 2011). Several interesting gene targets featured in the
networks developed by us using YAP overexpression in CGNPs. A concurrent
upregulation of IGF2 and H19, both imprinted genes, was observed.
Possible links between the Shh/Hippo pathways and IGF2 signaling also
featured in the networks developed in the study. Important links to lipid
metabolism, a process highly active in medulloblastomas and essential for
the proliferation of CGNPs, were also predicted. The study includes
results of signaling interactions between the Shh/Hippo pathways and
entities from other relevant pathways that together play a role in
medulloblastoma development and proliferation.
