Title: Oddities of DNA damage signaling in mitotic human cells revealed
by super-resolution microscopy.


Using an optimized cell-spreading technique combined with
immunofluorescence (IF) and super-resolution microscopy we examined in
greater detail DNA lesions induced within human mitotic chromosomes. We
found some major differences in DNA damage signaling of
mitosis-associated lesions induced by different genotoxic insults, such
as inducers of DNA replication stress and ionizing radiation. While the
former source of DNA damage represents a prominent inducer of genomic
instability - a hallmark of cancer, the latter treatment is commonly used
in cancer therapy. Differences in the DNA damage signal spreading and
participation of various DNA damage-responsive proteins differentially
recruited to sites of the DNA lesions are presented and discussed,
including our innovative techniques developed for quantitative IF
analysis of mitotic cells.
