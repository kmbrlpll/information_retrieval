Title: Functional analysis of a novel long ncRNA involved in the
tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer.


In recent years, the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies
has revealed that in addition to protein-coding genes, there are an even
larger number of RNA transcripts that do not encode proteins and are
instead defined as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Numerous ncRNAs are
misregulated in various diseases, especially cancer. We therefore
attempted to identify and characterize novel long ncRNAs that regulate
the tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer. Here we show that a novel long
ncRNA, termed NR-X, is required for proliferation and tumorigenicity of
colorectal cancer cells. We further show that NR-X is upregulated under
hypoxic conditions and induces expression of hypoxia-responsive genes.
Moreover, we succeeded to identify a chromatin-related protein that is
associated with NR-X. In this presentation, we would like to present our
data on the molecular functions of NR-X and discuss its significance in
tumorigenesis.
