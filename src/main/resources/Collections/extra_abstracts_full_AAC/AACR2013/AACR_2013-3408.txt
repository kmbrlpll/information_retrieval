Title: The anticancer mechanisms of ciclopirox olamine.


Ciclopirox olamine (CPX), a synthetic fungicide clinically used to treat
mycoses of the skin and nails, has been demonstrated as a novel
anticancer agent. However, the underlying anticancer mechanisms are not
well understood. Here we show that CPX suppressed cell proliferation,
induced cell death (apoptosis and autophagy), and inhibited cell motility
in breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30) cells. We
observed that CPX induced inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK2 and
inhibited cyclin D1 expression, resulting in dephosphorylation of Rb in
the tumor cells, which was correlated to cell cycle arrest at G1 phase.
Furthermore, we found that CPX caused DNA damage and activated ATR-Chk1
axis, increasing phosphorylation and degradation of Cdc25A, a critical
protein involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and
apoptosis. CPX also activated JNK cascade, associated with apoptosis.
Moreover, CPX downregulated cellular protein expression of small GTPases
(RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1) and induced inhibitory phosphorylation of FAK,
related to cell migration. In addition, we found that CPX inhibited the
signaling of mTOR, a central controller of cell proliferation, survival
(apoptosis and autophagy) and motility. The results suggest that CPX
exerts its anticancer activity by targeting multiple signaling molecules.
