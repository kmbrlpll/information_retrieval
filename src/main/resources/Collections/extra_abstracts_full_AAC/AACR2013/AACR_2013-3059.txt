Title: MicroRNA-140 dysfunction leads to hepatocarcinogenesis through
NF-B activation by impairing the regulation of NF-B coactivator.


Nuclear factor B (NF-B) is a transcriptional factor that regulates a set
of genes that are critical to many cellular biological processes,
including liver tumorigenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding
RNAs that regulate specific target gene expression.To determine the
miRNAs which are involved in regulating NF-B activation in the liver, we
screened for 60 kinds of miRNAs expressing in hepatocytes that can
modulate NF-B activation. We identified that miRNA-140 suppressed NF-B
activation significantly.Because miRNA-140 dysfunction was frequently
observed in human hepatocellular carcinomas, it was hypothesized that the
impairment of miRNA-140 function may be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis
through NF-B activation. Nuclear receptor interacting protein 1 (NRIP1)
which is coactivator of NF-B was identified as a target of miRNA-140 and
the increased NRIP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells this led to
enhanced NF-B activation and hepatocarcinogenesis. MiRNA-140 knockout
mice were indeed prone to hepatocarcinogenesis and had a phenotype
similar to results in vitro. These results indicate that miRNA-140 acts
as a liver tumor suppressor and the impairment of miRNA-140 function may
also lead to hepatocarcinogenesis.
