Title: Multicellular tumor spheroid models to evaluate drugs targeting
cell cycle checkpoints in 3D.


MultiCellular Tumor Spheroid (MCTS) mimic the organization of a tumor and
is considered as an invaluable model to study cancer cell biology and to
evaluate new antiproliferative drugs. We report how the characteristics
of MCTS in association with new technological developments can be used to
explore the regionalization, the dynamics of cell cycle checkpoints and
the effects of anticancer drugs in 3D. Spheroids expressing fluorescent
reporters were engineered and used to explore cell cycle distribution and
regionalization during growth. In these models we monitored cell cycle
arrest in response to checkpoint activation after growth factor
starvation, DNA injury or treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. The
kinetics and regionalized aspects of the response were investigated both
on fixed sections and on live spheroids using light sheet microscopy. All
together, our data demonstrate the power of the combination of spheroids
made of genetically modified cells expressing cell cycle reporters with
both classical antibody-based detection and the use of innovative 3D
imaging strategy. This study paves the way for the investigation of the
molecular aspects of checkpoint response in 3D models and the dynamic
studies of the 3D response to novel antiproliferative agents.
