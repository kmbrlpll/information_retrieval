Title: FGFR2 expression and mutation are rare in papillary renal cell
carcinoma.


Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is the second most common type of
renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1
signaling has been implicated to play a role in RCC (Tsimafeyeu et al.
ASCO meeting 2010). We evaluated expression and mutational activation of
FGFR2 as a potential target for therapy of pRCC.Formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded specimens of removed 71 primary tumors from untreated
pRCC patients were evaluated by immunohistochemistry with FGFR2 antibody.
FGFR2 mutations were assessed by PCR and direct sequencing, with DNA
obtained from 62 paraffin-embedded pRCC samples.Expression of FGFR2 was
observed in 8.5% of primary pRCC (6/71). Intensity was 3+ in all cases. 2
of 71 (3%) patients had nuclear FGFR2 expression. FGFR2 S252W mutation
was detected at low frequency (1/62, 1.6%) in pRCC (type I). No N549K
mutation was detected in pRCC (0/43).FGFR2 expression and mutation are
rare across papillary types of RCC.This study was supported by Mr. Sergey
Kartashov.
