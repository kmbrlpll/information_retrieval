Title: ER1 induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells by regulating growth
factor signaling.


Estrogens have recently been associated with the clinical outcome of
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The wild-type estrogen
receptor (ER1) one of the mediators of the estrogen signaling in cells is
expressed in lung cancer. However, the role of ER1 in NSCLC cell growth
has not been fully elucidated. Here we show that induction of ER1
expression inhibited cell growth in H1299 and A549 NSCLC cells. Treatment
of these cells with the ER agonists 17-estradiol or 3-Adiol further
decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. ER1 was found to
induce apoptosis through stimulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
that involves upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Bim. Inactivation
of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2 was found to be
involved in the ER1-mediated induction of apoptosis since treatment with
EGF that activates ERK1/2 abolished the ability of ER1 to sustain the
apoptotic phenotype. These results suggest that, by regulating NSCLC cell
growth, ER1 could be an important factor in biology of lung cancer and a
potentially useful component in the clinical management of the disease.
