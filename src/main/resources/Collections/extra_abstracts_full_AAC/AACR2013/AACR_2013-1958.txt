Title: Disregulation of TARBP-2 dependent miRNA maturation : A potential
new therapeutic target in Ewing sarcoma..


We have recently shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles is
the generation of the cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype in Ewing sarcoma
familly tumors (ESFT). Here we compared the miRNA expression profile of
ESFT CSCs to that of embryonic stem cells and CSCs from different tumor,
which seem to be shared by these different cell types. Our data suggests
that the mechanisms implicated in the miRNAs CSC signature rely on a
reversible TARBP-2 dependent miRNA maturation defect. Restoration of
TARBP2 activity either through chemical compounds or systemic delivery of
synthetic forms of two of its targets, miRNA-143 or miRNA-145, inhibited
ESFT CSC growth in vitro and in vivo. Taken together our observations
provide new therapeutic strategies through restoration of normal miRNA
expression profile, inhibiting CSC self-renewal and tumor maintenance.
