Title: Elucidating distinct roles for NF1 in melanomagenesis.


BRAF mutations play a well-established role in melanomagenesis; however,
without additional genetic alterations tumor development is restricted by
oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Here we show that mutations in the NF1
tumor suppressor gene cooperate with BRAF mutations in melanomagenesis by
preventing OIS. In a genetically engineered mouse model, Nf1 mutations
suppress Braf-induced senescence, promote melanocyte hyperproliferation,
and enhance melanoma development. Nf1 mutations function by deregulating
both PI3K and ERK pathways. As such, Nf1/Braf mutant tumors are resistant
to BRAF inhibitors but are sensitive to combined MEK/mTOR inhibition.
Importantly, NF1 is mutated or suppressed in human melanomas that harbor
concurrent BRAF mutations, NF1 ablation decreases the sensitivity of
melanoma cell lines to BRAF inhibitors, and NF1 is lost in tumors from
patients following treatment with these agents. Collectively, these
studies provide mechanistic insight into how NF1 cooperates with BRAF
mutations in melanoma and demonstrate that NF1-inactivation may impact
responses to targeted therapies.
