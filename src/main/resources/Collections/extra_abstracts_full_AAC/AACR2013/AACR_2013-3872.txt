Title: A lineage-selective transcriptional pathway linking lung
differentiation and cancer metastasis.


Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. This
poor prognosis is due to the rapid metastatic progression of this
disease, yet the mechanisms that govern lung cancer dissemination and
colonization are unclear. Through an integrated approach, we identified
an alveolar cell-selective gene signature that stratifies lung
adenocarcinoma (ADC) into molecular subtypes of distinct prognosis and
differentiation states. This transcriptional program is regulated in part
by the cell fate transcription factors, GATA6 and HOPX, which are
normally required for proper alveolar differentiation. In an experimental
model, suppression of GATA6 and HOPX cooperatively enhances metastatic
competence of lung ADC cells. Whole genome RNA sequencing reveals that
this transcriptional network can modulate specific target genes and
pathways involved in airway epithelial differentiation and invasion. Our
findings identify a novel cell lineage molecular program whose
perturbation enhances lung cancer metastasis.
