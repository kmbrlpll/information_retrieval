Title: PIM2 inhibitor as a targeted therapy for the treatment of multiple
myeloma patients with specific genetic signatures.


Jasco Pharmaceuticals has developed a novel and selective pan-PIM
inhibitor (JP_11646) that has demonstrated biochemical IC50s of 24, 0.5
and 1 nM for PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3 respectively. Jasco also developed an
engineered cell line to measure PIM2 transphosphorylation by
over-expressing human PIM2 in human HEK293 cells together with human BAD
as the substrate. The cell based assay measures the phosphorylation
levels of BAD at Ser112 attributed solely to PIM2. JP_11646 exhibited a
590 nM IC50 in this cell based PIM2 assay confirming the MOA. JP_11646
increases apoptosis and decreases cell viability in multiple myeloma cell
lines with the t(14;16) and t(4;14) translocations, which are known
markers for poor prognosis. JP_11646 is orally bioavailable and has
demonstrated in vivo efficacy, inhibiting tumor growth by >80% in a MM1.S
tumor xenograft study. These data provide solid rationale for further
development of JP_11646 as a targeted therapy for specific population of
multiple myeloma patients that exhibit these genetic markers.
