Title: Utilizing TCR and whole exome sequencing to determine the
clonality and mutational spectrum of p53-null thymic lymphomas.


The tumor suppressor p53 is nonfunctional in over 50% of cancers. The
ability for p53 to protect the cell from tumorigenesis is rooted in its
ability to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence following
genotoxic stress. Furthermore, loss of p53 in mice gives rise to
spontaneous thymic lymphomas and sarcomas. In this study, we used the
p53-KO mouse as a model for progression of tumorigenesis. We first
analyzed genomic DNA of p53-KO and WT normal thymus at various ages using
TCR sequencing. This procedure allowed us to determine the clonality of
the T cell repertoire. We then analyzed the clonality of p53-KO thymic
lymphomas. Our results indicated that while the highest T cell clone was
0.08% for normal thymus, the highest T cell clone for the p53-KO tumor
was 70%, indicating that the p53-KO thymic lymphomas were monoclonal.
Building on this data, we analyzed the mutations occurring in the thymic
lymphomas by mouse exome sequencing. We believe that combining TCR
sequencing with mouse exome sequencing will allow for a better
understanding of the clonality and genetic mutations required for
cellular transformation.
