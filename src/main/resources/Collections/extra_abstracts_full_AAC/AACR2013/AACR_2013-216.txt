Title: HMGB1 regulates homing capacity of human mesenchymal stromal cells
into colon cancer.


Recently a growing corpus of studies has highlighted the important aspect
of Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) therapy: systemically administered MSCs
home to sites of cancer. In this study, we focused on a homing mechanism
of human MSCs into cancer. First, we examined if cultured medium from
cancer cell lines could modulate migration of MSCs, the secretion level
of HMGB1 from six different colon cancer cell lines affected the
migration capacity of MSCs. In addition, recombinant HMGB1 could increase
the migration capacity in dose dependent manner. Finally, we applied MSCs
intracutaneously into mice bearing colon cancer using a cell line which
secreted high level of HMGB1. The in vivo bioluminescence live-image
showed that MSCs surrounded the tumors within 48hours after their
injection, additionally the immunohistochemistry revealed the existence
of MSCs in the tumors. These findings are critical in understanding the
role of MSCs in solid cancer, further they might facilitate therapeutic
application of MSCs in the treatment of cancer.
