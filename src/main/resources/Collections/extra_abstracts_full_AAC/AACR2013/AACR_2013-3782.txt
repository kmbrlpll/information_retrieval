Title: NEDD9 promotes cell invasion through modulation of Arf6-dependent
endocytic recycling.


The adaptor protein, NEDD9, is an established pro-metastatic trigger in
several cancers but the molecular mechanisms behind NEDD9-driven invasion
remain unclear. Here we show that expression of NEDD9 protein tightly
correlates with the transition of breast cancer to invasive stages.
Overexpression of NEDD9 is critical for the invasion of cancer cells but
depletion of NEDD9 is sufficient to block invasion. It is also well
established that invadopodia are important for cell invasion. We
demonstrate that NEDD9 localizes to invadopodia and its depletion leads
to a deficiency in matrix degradation. NEDD9 depletion was also
accompanied by an increase in surface levels of inactive proteases
(MT1-MMP) and adhesion receptors (integrins). In addition, depletion of
NEDD9 induced an increase in recycling and early endosomes via activation
of Arf6. NEDD9 binds to the Arf6 specific GAP, ASAP3, which explains
NEDD9 modulation of Arf6 activity. Inhibition of Arf6 or re-expression of
NEDD9 rescue in NEDD9-deficient cells is sufficient to restore proper
recycling rates and invasive properties of breast cancer cells. These
results reveal the mechanism behind NEDD9-driven migration and tumor
invasion.
