Title: Genomewide methylation and expression profiles in cervical cancer.


Cervical carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in females. This
cancer begins with precancerous stages and can evolves to carcinoma over
10 years or more. Cervical cancer is a multistep process with
accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in regulatory genes,
leading to activation of oncogenes and inactivation or loss of tumor
suppressor genes. We aimed to identify genetic alterations associated
with pre-cancerous stage and also with cervical cancer. For this purpose,
microarray comparative genomic hybridization(Illumina 450K and Illumina
Expression HT12 Human CGH Whole-Genome Arrays) was performed with 16
cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN) of different stages and
3 cases of carcinoma. We identified epigenetic inactivation of TSGs by
hyper- or hypo-methylation which has been recognized as an important and
alternative mechanism in tumorigenesis. Here we discuss these epigenetic
alterations in cervical intrapeithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer
focusing on DNA methylation.
