Title: Soluble CD80 restores T-cell activation and overcomes tumor cell
programmed death ligand-1-mediated suppression.


Many tumor cells escape anti-tumor immunity through their expression of
Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PDL1 or B7-H1), which interacts with T
cell-expressed PD1 and results in T cell apoptosis. We previously
reported that transfection of human tumor cells with a membrane-bound
form of the costimulatory molecule CD80 prevented PD1 binding and
restored T cell activation. We now report that membrane-bound CD80
similarly reduces PDL1-PD1-mediated suppression by mouse tumor cells, and
that a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domains of CD80
fused to an Fc domain of IgG1 overcomes PDL1-mediated suppression by
human tumor cells. T cell activation experiments assessing costimulation
indicate that the soluble CD80 fusion protein mediates its effects by
binding to PDL1 and inhibiting PDL1-PD1 interactions. Comparison of the
CD80 fusion protein to antibodies specific for PD1 or PDL1 demonstrate
that soluble CD80 treatment is more effective in restoring T cell
activation than treatment with mAb to either PD1 or PDL1. These studies
identify soluble CD80 as an alternative and potentially more efficacious
therapeutic agent for overcoming PDL1-induced immune suppression and
facilitating tumor-specific immunity.
