Title: A genome-wide association study of HCV induced liver cirrhosis in
the Japanese population identifies novel susceptibility loci at MHC
region.


To identify a prognostic factor(s) for patients with chronic hepatitis C
(CHC), we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 682
hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced liver cirrhosis (LC) cases and 1,045 CHC
patients in Japan. Eight SNPs which showed possible associations (P To
identify a prognostic factor(s) for patients with chronic hepatitis C
(CHC), we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 682
hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced liver cirrhosis (LC) cases and 1,045 CHC
patients in Japan. Eight SNPs which showed possible associations (P < 1.0
x 10-5) in the GWAS stage were further genotyped using 936 LC cases and
3,809 CHC patients. We found that two SNPs within the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21, rs910049 and
rs3135363, were significantly associated with the progression from CHC to
LC (Pcombined = 9.15 x 10-11 and 1.45 x 10-10, odds ratio (OR) = 1.46 and
1.37, respectively). We also found that HLA-DQA1*0601 and HLA-DRB1*0405
were associated with progression from CHC to LC (P = 4.53 x 10-4 and 1.54
x 10-4 with OR = 2.80 and 1.45, respectively). Multiple logistic
regression analysis revealed that rs3135363, rs910049, and HLA-DQA1*0601
were independently associated with the risk of HCV-induced LC. In
addition, individuals with four or more risk alleles for these three loci
have a 2.83-fold higher risk for LC than those with no risk allele,
indicating the cumulative effects of these variations. Our findings
elucidated the crucial roles of multiple genetic variations within the
MHC region as prognostic/predictive biomarkers for CHC patients.
