Title: Oligodeoxynucleotides expressing Poly-G motifs promote anti-tumor
activity through the up-regulation of IL-2.


The primary goal of cancer immunotherapy is to elicit an immune response
capable of eliminating the tumor. One approach towards accomplishing that
goal utilizes general (rather than tumor-specific) immunomodulatory
agents to boost the number and activity of pre-existing cytotoxic T
lymphocytes. We find that the intra-tumoral injection of poly-G ODN has
such an effect, boosting anti-tumor immunity and promoting tumor
regression. The anti-tumor activity of poly-G ODN was mediated through
CD8 T cells in a TLR9 independent manner. Mechanistically, poly-G ODN
directly induced the phosphorylation of Lck (an essential element of the
T cell signaling pathway), thereby enhancing the production of IL-2 and
CD8 T cell proliferation. These findings establish poly-G ODN as a novel
type of cancer immunotherapy.
