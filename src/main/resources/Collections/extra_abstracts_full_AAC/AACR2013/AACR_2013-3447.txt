Title: Obatoclax analogue SC-2001 induced autophagy through SHP1/STAT3
pathway in hepatocelluar carcinoma.


Obatoclax induced cancer cells apoptosis through targeting anti-Bcl-2
family. Previously, we have generated 20 obatoclax analogues with three
synthetic steps and tested cytotoxicity in HCC cell lines. Among these
analogues, SC-2001 not only inhibited anti-Bcl-2 family activity but also
reduced STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequently repressed transcriptional
activity of STAT3 targeting genes. Here, we further revealed that SC-2001
induced LC3-II with time and dose dependent manner in HCC cell line. We
also observed that autophogosomes were induced with SC-2001 treated cells
under electron microscope detection. Conversely, sodium vanadate, a
phosphatase inhibitor, abolished the LC3 induction and autophagic effect
in SC-2001 treated cells. In addition, overexpression of STAT3 in PLC5
cells attenuate autophagic effect with SC-2001 treatment. Genetic
knockdown of SHP-1, a negative regulator of STAT3, by siRNA reduced
autophagy induced by SC-2001. In summary, our data suggested that SC-2001
can induce autophagic cell death through, at least in part, SHP-1/STAT3
signaling pathway. (Supported by NSC-100-2325-B-010-007)
