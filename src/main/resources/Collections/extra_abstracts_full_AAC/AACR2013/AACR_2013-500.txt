Title: Role of R-spondin4 in Wnt/-catenin signaling and cell
proliferation in breast cancer.


R-spondin 4 (Rspo4) is a member of the Rspo protein family, which is
another group of secreted proteins that can activate Wnt/-catenin
signaling. Although it is well recognized that Wnt/-catenin signaling is
important for breast cancer development and progression, the role of
Rspo4 in breast cancer is unclear. In the present study, we found that
Rspo4 was expressed in breast cancer cell lines, but absent in normal
mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). We also found that Rspo4 expression was
up-regulated in human malignant breast tissues. Moreover, Rspo4 acted
synergistically with Wnt3A to activate Wnt/-catenin signaling in breast
cancer cells. Conversely, reducing endogenous Rspo4 with siRNAs in human
breast cancer cell lines suppressed Wnt/-catenin signaling and cell
proliferation. These data suggest that Rspo4 functions as a positive
regulator of breast cancer proliferation by activating Wnt/-catenin
signaling.
