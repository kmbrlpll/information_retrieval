Title: WISP-1 increases cell migration and ICAM-1 expression in human
oral squamous cell carcinomas.


Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) have a striking tendency to
migration and metastasis to cervical lymph nodes. Wnt-1 induced secreted
protein 1 (WISP-1) belongs to the CCN family (CTGF/CYR61/NOV), which is
secreted cysteine-rich proteins. However, the effects of WISP-1 on
migration and Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in
human OSCC are largely unknown. First, we found that the expression of
WISP-1 in human OSCC tissues was higher than in normal oral tissues. We
also demonstrated that WISP-1 enhanced cell migration and ICAM-1
up-regulation in human OSCC. Transfection of cells with ICAM-1 siRNA
reduced WISP-1-mediated cell migration. WISP-1 activated v3 integrin,
ASK1, JNK/p38, c-Jun, and AP-1 signal transduction pathway, and
WISP-1-induced expression of ICAM-1 and migration activity was inhibited
by the v3 antibody or inhibitor of ASK1, p38, JNK, and c-Jun. In
addition, human OSCC were infected with lentivirus containing human
WISP-1 shRNA which reduced the migratory ability and ICAM-1 expression.
Over all, we characterized an important role for WISP-1 which regulates
cell migratoin by increasing ICAM-1 expression in human OSCC via the v3
integrin, ASK1, JNK/p38, c-Jun, and AP-1 signaling pathway.
