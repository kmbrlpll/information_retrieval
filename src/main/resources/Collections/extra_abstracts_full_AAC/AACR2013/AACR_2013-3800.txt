Title: Osteonectin suppresses proliferation and migration of human
prostate cancer cells.


Osteonectin/SPARC(Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine)/BM-40 is
an extracellular protein that has been studied in ECM(Extra Cellular
Matrix) organization, immune modulation, proliferation, adhesion,
invasion and migration in various cancers. Advanced prostate cancer (PCa)
is significantly affected by cross-talk among cancer cells, stromal cells
and ECM. Such communication is particularly could contribute to migration
and invasion of prostate cancer cells. However, the precise mechanism in
migration and invasion of PCa cells are poorly understood. In this
report, we investigated the effect of osteonectin on proliferation,
migration and invasion of PCa cells. Indeed, Prostate-derived stromal
cells (PrSC) has been shown to express high mRNA levels of osteonectin
and secret relatively high levels of osteonectin. We revealed that
osteonectin from PrSC and refined osteonectin protein also inhibited
activation of AKT-p21 signaling, which plays an important role in
prostate cancer cell growth, and affected down-regulation of migration
and invasion of LNCaP cells. Together, these studies support a conclusion
that interaction of stromal cells and PCa cells as osteonectin play an
important role in progression of prostate cancer.
