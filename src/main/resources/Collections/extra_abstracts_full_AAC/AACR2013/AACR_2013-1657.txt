Title: Targeting Cullin-RING ligases by MLN4924 induces autophagy via
modulating the HIF1-REDD1-TSC1-mTORC1-DEPTOR axis in breast cancer cells.


MLN4924, a newly discovered small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-Activating
Enzyme (NAE), inactivates Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) by
blocking cullin neddylation. As a result, MLN4924 causes accumulation of
several key substrates of CRLs and effectively suppresses tumor cell
growth by inducing apoptosis and senescence. However, the role of MLN4924
in induction of autophagy and its biological significance are totally
unknown. Here we showed that MLN4924 effectively induces autophagy in
both time- and dose-dependent manners in breast cancer cells.
Mechanistically, by inactivating CRLs, MLN4924 causes accumulation of
DEPTOR and HIF1. The siRNA knockdown and gene KO studies showed that
DEPTOR and the HIF1-REDD1-TSC1 axis are responsible for MLN4924-induced
autophagy via inhibiting mTORC1. Biologically, autophagy is a survival
signal to tumor cells, and blockage of autophagy via siRNA knockdown,
gene KO and small molecule inhibitor remarkably enhanced MLN4924-induced
apoptosis. Our study reveals an uncharacterized mechanism of MLN4924
action and provides the proof-of-concept evidence for strategic drug
combination of MLN4924 with an autophagy inhibitor for maximal killing of
tumor cells via enhancing apoptosis.
