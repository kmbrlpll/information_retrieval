Title: Dynamics changes in antigen-autoantibody profiles involving
glycolysis and spliceosome proteins precede a diagnosis of ER+ and triple
negative breast cancer among post-menopausal women.


We assessed the circulating autoantibody repertoire in breast cancer
using genetically engineered mouse models and human plasmas collected at
a pre-clinical time point and at the time of clinical diagnosis of breast
cancer. We aimed to identify common pathways, networks and protein
families associated with the humoral response to tumors and to elucidate
the dynamic nature of tumor antigens and autoantibody interactions in ER+
and triple negative breast cancer. Lysate proteins from immortalized
mouse cell lines from MMTV-neu and C3(1)-T mouse models and from the MCF7
and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines were spotted onto
nitrocellulose microarrays and hybridized with mouse and human plasma
samples, respectively. Ig-based plasma immunoreactivity against
glycolysis and spliceosome proteins was a predominant feature observed
both in MMTV-neu tumor bearing mice and in pre-diagnostic ER+ human
samples. A cytoskeletal signature was uniquely observed in C3(1)-T mice
and in human patients with triple negative breast cancer. We provide
evidence for dynamic changes in autoantibody reactivity and in
antigen-antibody interactions with tumor development and progression.
