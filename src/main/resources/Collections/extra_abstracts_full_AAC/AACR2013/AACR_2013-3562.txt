Title: Genome-wide analysis of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding sites
reveals vitamin D role modulating autophagy and metabolism in
luminal-like breast cancer cells.


The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3),
regulates gene expression through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Even
though 1,25D3 is still best known as a regulator of bodily calcium
homeostasis, 1,25D3 has a plethora of physiological actions which include
immune and nervous system modulation, cellular proliferation and
differentiation. Epidemiological and model studies have revealed the
cancer-protective properties of 1,25D3 in colon, prostate and notably in
breast. We are actively investigating the anti-proliferative properties
of 1,25D3 in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines. We found that
1,25D3 induces autophagy in several luminal-like breast cancer cell
models, but not in basal-like or mesenchymal-like models. We performed
VDR and signaling partner RXR whole-genome ChIP-seq analysis to uncover
all of the direct 1,25D3 target genes involved in regulation of
metabolism and autophagy. Our studies suggest that energy regulation as
an important aspect of 1,25D3 anti-proliferative properties in
luminal-like breast cancer cells.
