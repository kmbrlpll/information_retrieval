Title: Mechanistic study of a new 4-(3,
5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(7-fluoro-3-methoxyquinoxalin-2-yl)piperazine-1-carbox
amide compound (RX-5902).


In our previous study, we showed that a novel compound
1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(6-fluoro-2-methoxyquinoxalin-3-yl)aminocarbonyl
] piperazine induces apoptosis of cancer cells by downregulation of Bcl-2
protein levels and causing G2/M cell cycle arrest. We observed also a
synergistic effect in growth inhibition when combined with known
anticancer agents in cancer cells and potent anti-growth activity in
drug-resistant cancer cells as well as anti-proliferation of cancer cells
at IC50 values of low nanomolar concentrations. Oral administration of
the compound led to inhibition of tumor growth and enhanced survival in
several tumor xenograft models. Our recent studies indicated that the
compound interacts with p68 RNA helicase (also known as DDX5), a member
of the DEAD box family of RNA helicases. p68 has been demonstrated to
play a vital role in cell proliferation and tumor/cancer progression. Our
studies showed that the compound did not exert its anti-cancer effects by
inhibition of RNA unwinding by p68. Instead, the compound completely
abrogated the -catenin stimulated ATPase activity of p68 with an IC50 of
61 nM. More extensive studies are ongoing to validate and further
characterize our interesting discovery.
