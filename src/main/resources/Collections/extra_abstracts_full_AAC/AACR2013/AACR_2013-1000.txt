Title: ATP7A mutation reduces resistance to chemotherapy agents in vitro
and in vivo.


The Menkes protein (ATP7A), a copper-translocating P-type ATPase, is
responsible for the loading of copper from the cytosol into secretory
compartments of the cell for incorporation into newly synthesized
copper-requiring enzymes. Previous studies using cultured cell lines have
suggest that ATP7A is able to modulate cellular accumulation of
cisplatin, a platinum-containing chemotherapy agent. In this study, we
generate isogenic ATP7A-WT and ATP7A-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast
cells line pairs. We demonstrate that ATP7A deletion significantly
decreases cellular resistance to cell cycle non-specific platinum agents,
cisplatin & carboplatin and cell cycle specific alkaloid agent,
vincristine sulfate. In addition, loss of ATP7A sensitizes xenograft
tumor growth to cisplatin toxicity. These findings identify the ATP7A
copper transporter as an active participant in multidrug resistance
pathways in vivo, underscoring this transporter as a potential drug
target to augment platinum-based chemotherapeutics.
