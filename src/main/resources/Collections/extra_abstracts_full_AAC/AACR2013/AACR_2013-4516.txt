Title: Targeted delivery of resveratrol to improve therapeutic outcome in
prostate cancer.


Conventional chemotherapeutics offered to treat prostate cancer (PCa) are
not selectively targeted and due to this fact they are toxic to the
normal cells. Thus, it is imperative to identify new anti-cancer agents
and/or methods to selectively target PCa cells without affecting normal
cells. In this regard, resveratrol (trans-3, 5, 4-trihydroxystilbene), a
plant polyphenol, has shown very promising results. Despite the proven
anti-tumor effects of resveratrol, clinical use of this compound is
restricted due to its poor bioavailability. To surmount these problems,
we developed nanoparticles, loaded with resveratrol, using a
planetary-balled milling (PBM) technique and tagged them with folate for
targeted delivery to PCa cells, which express high affinity folate
receptors. Image Stream multispectral imaging was used to measure the
response of resveratrol-loaded PBM nanoparticles, and free resveratrol on
various PCa cell lines. Resveratrol-loaded folic acid-coated PBM
nanoparticles selectively targeted PCa cells and induced apoptosis.
Furthermore, our results indicate that targeted delivery of resveratrol
using PBM nanoparticles was 70-85% more effective in killing PCa cells at
concentrations lower than the IC50 of free resveratrol.
