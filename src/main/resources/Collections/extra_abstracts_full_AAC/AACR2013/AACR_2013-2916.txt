Title: NOXX: Friend or foe for cellular proliferation.


Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are signaling molecules that determine
cellular fate. In tumor progression, ROS have been suggested to function
as a dual cell controller. They could induce cellular proliferation in
low levels while inhibiting cellular proliferation in high levels. ROS
can be produced by NOXX, a member of NADPH oxidase family. Here, we
present that an increase in NOXX levels by activation of STAT5 are
critical in tumor progression by comparing the NOXX levels of breast and
lung tumor tissues to those of normal tissues. Consistently, depletion of
NOXX causes tumor suppression of lung and breast cancer cells, and
expression of NOXX induces proliferation of normal lung cells. Notably,
we found that cisplatin, an antineoplastic agent, increases NOXX activity
and inhibits cellular proliferation. Specifically, cisplatin activates
NOXX to induce a high level of ROS in multiple ways through (i) an
increase in NOXX levels, (ii) an increase in levels of c-abl which is an
activator of NOXX, and (iii) a release of Ca2+, the other activator of
NOXX. Together, NOXX is a double-edged sword for tumorigenesis in lung
and breast cancers by modulating ROS levels, and will be a promising
target for cancer therapy.
