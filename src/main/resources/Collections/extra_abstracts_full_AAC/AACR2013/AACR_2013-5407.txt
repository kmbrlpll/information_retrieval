Title: The novel roles of BRCA1/ATM-associated BRAT1 in
glucose/mitochondrial metabolism and tumor cell growth.


BRAT1 (BRCA1-associated ATM activator) was identified as a novel
DNA-damage response protein. It physically interacts with both BRCA1 and
ATM, and is required for ATM-activation under conditions of cell stress.
We have recently discovered that it also binds to DNA-PKs, implicating
the broad role of BRAT1 in DNA repair as well as in DNA damage response.
By taking advantage of BRAT1 knockdown HeLa and U2OS cells, we found that
loss of BRAT1 expression significantly decreased cell proliferation and
tumorigenecity both in vitro and in vivo. Cell motility is remarkably
lowered when BRAT1 is depleted. These results demonstrate novel function
of BRAT1 in cell proliferation, migration, and tumorigenesis of cancer
cells. Interestingly, glucose uptake and production of mitochondrial ROS
(reactive oxygen species) are highly increased in BRAT1 knockdown. These
findings suggest novel functions of BRAT1 in regulating glucose
metabolism and mitochondrial function. Functional interaction of
BRCA1/ATM pathway and glucose/mitochondria metabolism are discussed.
