Title: TP-0413 is a dual-specific inhibitor against Jak2 and Alk2 with
therapeutic potential for treating anemia of chronic disease.


Anemia of chronic disease is a debilitating condition commonly found in
cancer patients. Studies suggest that this syndrome is largely the result
of the body's production of hepcidin, a master regulator of human iron
metabolism. TP-0413 is a small molecule that targets two important
components of the hepcidin pathway, Janus Kinase 2 (Jak2) and Activin A
receptor, type I (Alk-2). Jak2 facilitates hepcidin function by
phosphorylating ferroportin upon hepcidin binding, inducing its
degradation and thus preventing iron entry into plasma. Alk2 on the other
hand, is a component of the signal transduction pathway that leads to
hepcidin expression. Here we report on recent efforts aimed at further
characterization of TP-0413. In biochemical assays TP-0413 inhibits Jak2
and Alk2 at 3.11 nM and 70 nM, respectively (IC50). In cell culture,
HepG2 cells treated with TP-0413 exhibit reduced hepcidin levels, and
TP-0413 is able to inhibit BMP-2 induction of hepcidin. Furthermore,
TP-0413 ameliorates hypoferremia induced by LPS treatment in mice, and
modulates cytokine levels in these animals. TP-0413 shows favorable
drug-like properties in pharmacokinetic models, and further studies are
being undertaken to advance TP-0413 towards clinical trials.
