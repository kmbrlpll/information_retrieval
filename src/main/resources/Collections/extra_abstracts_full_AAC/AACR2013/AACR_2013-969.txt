Title: The anti-apoptotic impact of neurotrophic factor GDNF on breast
cancer cells pre-treated with trastuzumab.


Reports on breast cancer resistance to hormone/antibody therapy indicate
molecular switches between membrane or non-membrane tyrosine kinase
receptors may be key players. We investigated the impact of glial cell
line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on the activity of these
receptors in breast cancer cell lines pre-treated with trastuzumab that
blocks her2. We found by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses that GDNF
activates SRC via GDNF-specific receptor Ret leading to SRC-AKT
interaction in the lipid raft of the cell membrane. Consequently, p53 is
phosphorylated and interacts with MDM2 that ultimately inhibits
apoptosis. Phosphorylation and activation events occurred more robustly
in SKBR3, a cell line with strong her2 expression, than in MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 both having lower expression levels of her2. Inhibition of the
SRC-AKT interaction using an SRC-specific antibody blocked GDNF-promoted
anti-apoptotic effects. We found similar changes when we replaced cell
lines with her2-positive tumor cells collected from breast cancer
patients. GDNF is introduced a molecular switch for promoting drug
resistance in breast cancer therapy.
