Title: Efficient tumor therapy by anthrax toxin fusion proteins that
contain cytolethal distending toxin B.


Cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) is produced by several Gram-negative
bacterial species. It is composed of three subunits, CdtA, CdtB, and
CdtC, with CdtB being the catalytic subunit. We fused CdtB from
Haemophilus ducreyi with the N-terminal 254 amino acids of Bacillus
anthracis toxin lethal factor (LFn) to produce a novel, potent anti-tumor
drug. CdtB is transported into the cytosol of targeted cells via the
efficient delivery mechanism of anthrax toxin. The fusion protein
efficiently killed various human tumor cell lines by inducing a complete
cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and subsequently inducing apoptosis.
Despite the described role of CdtB as a DNase, we detected a prominent
phosphatase activity of CdtB, similar to phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN) activity. Animal studies showed very low toxicity of a
systemically-applied tumor-specific treatment and impressive anti-tumor
effects, resulting in a 90% cure rate. This study demonstrates the great
potential of a combination of efficient drug delivery by a modified
anthrax toxin system and the enzymatic activity of CdtB, and argues for
the continued development of this novel anti-cancer drug.
