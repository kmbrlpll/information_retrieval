Title: Regulation of EGFR in pancreatic cancer.


EGFR and EGFR ligand upregulation has been widely seen in both human
chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) for many
years; however the role of EGFR in PDA was poorly understood. Recently we
and others have shown that genetic ablation of EGFR effectively prevents
both spontaneous and cerulein induced tumorigenesis in the pancreas of
the LSL-KrasG12D/+;Ptf1aCre/+ (KC) mouse model of pancreatic
tumorigenesis. Pockets of EGFR upregulation localized in single acini of
KC mice appear to precede pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)
formation in spontaneous tumorigenesis, coupled with a distinct spatially
localized immune response. Ubiquitous EGFR upregulation is observed
throughout the pancreas upon induction of pancreatitis in wild-type (WT)
and KC mice, returning to normal levels in WT mice but continuing to
increase along with the widespread tumorigenesis in cerulein treated KC
mice. Comparison of cerulein treated KC mice with the
EGFRf/f;LSL-KrasG12D/+;Ptf1aCre/+ mice (EKC), which are largely resistant
to cerulein induced pancreatitis, offers an opportunity to identify
signals in the KC mouse which could be responsible for the upregulation
of EGFR and subsequent tumorigenesis.
