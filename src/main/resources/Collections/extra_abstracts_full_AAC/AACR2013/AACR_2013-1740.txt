Title: SATB2 localizes to mitotic microtubules and centrosome of cell
cycles and regulates G1 phase cell cycle via proteosomal-dependent CDK2
in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells.


Though special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2) is known as a
transcriptional regulator of skeletal development and osteogenic
differentiation, the underlying role of SATB2 still remains unclear. In
the present study, we found that SATB2 localized to the mitotic
microtubules, centrosome and midbodies in mitotic cells with -tubulin.
SATB2 knockdown by siRNA transfection reduced the cell viability, and
increased the number of ethidium homodimer positive stained cells in
SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. Consistently, cell cycle analysis revealed
that SATB2 knockdown accumulated G1 arrest and downregulated the
cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) expression by western blotting, while
immunofluorescence assay revealed that CDK2 and SATB2 were co-localized
in SKOV3 cells. Furthermore, proteosomal inhibitor MG132 treatment
reversed the downregulation of CDK2 induced by SATB2 knockdown in SKOV3
cells. Overall, our findings suggest that SATB2 regulates the mitosis and
G1 phase cell cycle via proteosomal ubiquitination in SKOV3 ovarian
cancer cells.
