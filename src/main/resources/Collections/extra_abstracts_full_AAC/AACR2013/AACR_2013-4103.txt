Title: Ptprz gene encoding a transmembrane-type protein phosphatase is
up-regulated by Sox-2 in glioma.


Ptprz is a receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) abundantly
expressed in neuronal and glial cells in the central nervous system. To
date, several potential substrates of Ptprz such as p190RhoGAP, ErbB4,
and Git-1, have been identified. In terms of its biological functions,
for example, it was shown that Ptprz regulates differentiation of glial
cells, but its role(s) in gliomagenesis remains obscue.In this study,
expression of Ptprz mRNA in human glioma samples were analyzed. Ptprz
mRNA was up-regulated in glioma when compared to normal brain. We found
that the levels of Ptprz mRNA in specimens are correlated with those of
Sox-2, a transcription factor associating with glioma stemness.
Knock-down of Sox-2 by siRNA decreased Ptprz mRNA of several glioma
cell-lines. ChIP analysis showed the physical association of Sox2 to the
putative promoter region of Ptprz gene, suggesting that Ptprz is a direct
transcriptional target of Sox-2. Up-regulation of Ptprz expression may be
a part of transcriptional program elicited by Sox-2, which may contribute
to glioma stemness
