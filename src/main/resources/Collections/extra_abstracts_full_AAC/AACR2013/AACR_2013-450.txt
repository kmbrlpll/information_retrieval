Title: Host-tumor immune response for breast cancer patients.


We demonstrated immune suppression of regulatory T cells (Treg) and M2
macrophage in breast cancer (BC) patients at AACR 2011. In summary, to
compare between 38 early and 12 advanced BC cases, CD163-positive tumor
cells and CCR4-positive tumor cells were detected more frequently in
advanced cases than in early cases. Treg cells in PBMC significantly
increased in percentage of the population in 37 BC patients than in 21
healthy volunteers. To explore host-tumor immune response, several
cytokines were examined in the same cases. Plasma from 32 early and 9
advanced BC cases was preoperatively obtained. Human IL-2, IL-4, IL-6,
IL-10, TNF, INF, and IL-17A were measured using cytometric beads array
system. Statistical significance was analyzed using Mann-Whitney U-test.
Plasma IL-17A had significantly higher levels in early BC than in
advanced BC (103 pg/ml v.s. 51 pg/ml at mean level). Th17 cells may have
some potential to control tumor progression in BC. In conclusions,
induction of host-tumor immune response due to chemotherapy and anti-HER2
therapy and release from immune suppression such as CCR4 monoclonal
antibody are important issues to explore a new strategy for BC patients.
