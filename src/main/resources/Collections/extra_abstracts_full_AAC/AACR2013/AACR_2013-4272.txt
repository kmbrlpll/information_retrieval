Title: NanoLucTM as an improved BRET donor to monitor EGFR interactions
within living cells.


As a small, versatile protein fusion reporter, NanoLuc luciferase offers
superior brightness and sensitivity compared to any luciferase described
to date. The small size and enhanced brightness of NanoLuc makes it
ideally suited as an energy donor for Bioluminescence Resonance Energy
Transfer (BRET) to a variety of fluorescent acceptors within living
cells. By combining genetic reporters such as NanoLuc luciferase and
HaloTag fluorescent labelling technology, it is possible to monitor the
interactions of cell surface receptors such as EGFR with adapter proteins
in response to growth factor stimulation. In addition to demonstrating
inducible protein interactions, it may also be possible to apply this
foundational BRET system to the measurement of ligand or small molecule
binding events within living cells.
