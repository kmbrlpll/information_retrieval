Title: Colorectal Cancer Mortality in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and
Singapore.


Although colorectal cancer mortality has started to decrease in many
Western countries, its high incidence and mortality in most Asian
countries are challenging health problems. We analyzed the colorectal
cancer mortality in four Asian countries using the World Health
Organization mortality database and the Korea National Statistics Office
database. The annual age-standardized rates and truncated rated for the
three age groups (30-49/50-69/70+ years) for Hong Kong (1969-2009), Japan
(1955-2009), Korea (1985-2006), and Singapore (1966-2009) were estimated.
A joinpoint regression model was used to detect significant trends in
mortality rates. Colorectal cancer mortality in men started to decrease
in 1992 in Japan followed by Singapore and Hong Kong in 1995. The
mortality rates in women stared to decrease in 1980 in Singapore,
followed by Hong Kong and Japan in 1996. In all countries and both
genders, except for women in Singapore, the decrease in mortality began
in the younger age groups. In conclusion, the colorectal cancer mortality
in the four studied Asian countries has started to decrease, and the
decrease occurred first in the younger age groups.
