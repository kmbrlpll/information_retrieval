Title: PTEN levels are controlled by a nuclear transport receptor in lung
cancer.


The maintenance of PTEN protein levels is critical for tumor suppression.
Yet, the ubiquitination system has been shown to affect PTEN levels both
adversely through degradation, as well as positively through nuclear
import, and it has remained unclear how these two processes are
integrated to prevent cancer. Here we show, that a nuclear import
receptor is at the heart of a failsafe system that maintains PTEN levels
by mediating its nuclear transport. Loss of import receptor function not
only leads to cytoplasmic PTEN accumulation but also prompts PTEN
degradation through a novel component of the PTEN ubiquitination
system.By testing the consequences of importin loss in vivo, we found
that hypomorphic mice developed lung adenocarcinoma, which presented with
aberrant cytoplasmic PTEN localization and degradation, as predicted by
our in vitro findings. Since the corresponding human locus suffers
frequent deletion as well as inactivating mutations in lung cancer, we
propose that this import receptor is a novel tumor suppressor that
antagonizes PI 3-Kinase signaling in settings with at least one intact
PTEN gene.
