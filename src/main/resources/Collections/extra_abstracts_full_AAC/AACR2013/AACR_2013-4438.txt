Title: Gold nanoparticle imaging and radiotherapy of brain tumors in mice.


Aims: To test intravenously injected gold nanoparticles for X-ray imaging
and radiotherapy enhancement of large, imminently lethal intracerebral
malignant gliomas. Materials & Methods: 11nm gold nanoparticles were
injected intravenously and brains imaged by microCT. Fifteen hours after
an iv dose of 4 g Au/kg, brains were irradiated with 30 Gy 100kVp X-rays.
Results: Gold uptake gave a 19:1 tumor-to-normal brain ratio with 1.5%
w/w gold in tumor, calculated to increase local radiation dose by 300%.
Mice receiving gold and radiation (30 Gy) showed 50% long-term (> 1 year)
tumor-free survival, whereas all mice receiving radiation only died. In a
second experiment using 35 Gy, long-term survival was 56% with AuNPs plus
radiation versus 18% with radiation alone. Combining both experiments,
the radiation plus AuNP treatments were statistically distinct from the
radiation-only groups (p = 0.014). Conclusions: Intravenously injected
gold nanoparticles cross the blood-tumor barrier but are largely blocked
by the normal blood brain barrier, enabling high-resolution CT tumor
imaging. Gold radiation enhancement significantly improved long-term
survival compared to radiotherapy alone. This approach holds promise to
improve therapy of human brain tumors and other cancers.
