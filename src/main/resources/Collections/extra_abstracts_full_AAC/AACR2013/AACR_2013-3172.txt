Title: Pooled RNAi screens in xenograft mouse models.


We present results of clonal analysis studies aimed at characterizing the
heterogeneity of in vivo cancer cell growth in xenograft models. Using a
high-throughput sequencing method, we followed the fate of thousands of
individually bar-coded cancer cells grown in vitro, or in vivo upon
sub-cutaneous implantation in immunocompromised mice. By precisely and
reproducibly quantifying clonal cancer cell growth in vivo, we found that
xenograft growth is marked by a phenomenon of clonal dominance, in which
a small subset of cancer cell sub-clones account for the bulk of the
resulting tumor mass. This phenomenon has important implications for the
field of in vivo shRNA screening. Subsequently, we developed a new
proprietary clonal RNAi screening platform specifically designed to
circumscribe the clonal dominance effect in xenograft model viability
screens. We used this technology to perform xenograft drop-out screens in
a panel of tumorigenic cell lines, including human breast, ovarian and
colon carcinomas. Preliminary data will be presented. These results
demonstrate that complex pooled shRNA libraries provide a highly
efficient, flexible, and unique tool for in vivo screens aimed the
discovery of potential cancer therapy targets.
