Title: Neutrophil tracking study on mammary tumors using bioluminescence
imaging in vivo.


Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are the most abundant circulating
blood leukocytes. They are part of the innate immune system and provide a
first line of defense by migrating toward areas of inflammation in
response to chemical signals that have been released from the site. Like
inflammation, cancer also causes activation of PMNs and release of
myeloperoxidase. In this study, we demonstrate that giving a small amount
of luminol to mice that have been transplanted with 4T1 mammary tumor
cells allows detection of myeloperoxidase activity. Luminol allowed
detection of activation of PMNs only two days after cancer cell
transplantation, even though tumors were not yet palpable. In conclusion,
luminol-bioluminescence imaging (BLI) can provide a way to image certain
tumors at an early stage.
