Title: Chronic myeloid leukemia in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor knockout
mouse.


The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a sensor of environmental toxins
such as TCDD and its activation by these ligands can lead to immune
system impairment, endocrine disruption and cancer. However, the normal
physiological functions of AhR are still under investigation. We have
previously reported the presence of large uric acid stones in the urinary
bladder of AhR-/- mice and have traced this uric acid to rapid
degradation of cells. In order to identify the cells that are dying, we
examined the immune system of these mice. AhR -/- mice develop
splenomegaly, increased number of megakaryocytes, increased circulating
white blood cell count, enlarged lymph nodes, abnormalities in the bone
marrow with many immature blast cells and severe myeloid cell
infiltration into the liver and other tissues. The immune phenotype in
these mice worsens as they age. The AhR -/- mouse phenotype, diagnosed as
chronic myeloid leukemia, is similar to that of ER -/- mice but there is
no loss of ER in AhR-/- mice. These studies suggest a novel mechanism for
the development of chronic myeloid leukemia.
