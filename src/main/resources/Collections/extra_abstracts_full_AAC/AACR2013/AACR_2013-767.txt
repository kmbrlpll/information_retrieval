Title: RalGTPase regulation of p53 and its contribution to malignant
transformation.


The regulation of the tumor suppressor p53 by Ral GTPases and its
contribution to malignant transformation are not known. Here we
demonstrate that the expression of K-Ras, Ral A and Ral B, but not Akt1/2
and c-Raf, is required for maintaining low levels of p53 in human cancer
cells that harbor mutant K-Ras and wild type p53. Depletion of Ral A and
Ral B increases p53 protein levels by increasing its stability and this
results in p53-dependent up regulation of p21waf and mdm2. Furthermore,
depletion of Ral A and / or Ral B leads to a p53-dependent decrease in
the proportion of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle, inhibition of
anchorage-independent growth and suppression of invasion. Thus,
expression of Ral proteins is critical to maintaining low levels of p53,
and this appears to be critical to the ability of Ral GTPase to induce
malignant transformation.
