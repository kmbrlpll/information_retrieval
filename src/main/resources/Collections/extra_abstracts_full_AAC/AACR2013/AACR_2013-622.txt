Title: Degradation of APE1 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin.


The mammalian apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1/Ref1) is a DNA
repair/redox regulator protein of which cytoplasmic accumulation has been
associated with tumorigenesis and poor survival outcome. APE1 is degraded
through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and previous studies reported
APE1 ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligases MDM2 and UBR3. Here we
report that Parkin efficiently polyubiquitinated and degraded APE1.
Parkin, a product of the PARK2 gene, is responsible for a type of early
onset Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been identified as a tumor
suppressor. Expression of Parkin and Pink1 enhanced APE1 ubiquitination
and markedly decreased endogenous APE1 in A549, a lung adenocarcinoma
cell line. APE1 degradation was blocked by incubation of the cells with
MG132, a potent 26S proteasome inhibitor, and by a PD associated point
mutation in the Parkin RING domain. The activity of PTEN induced-kinase 1
(Pink1) was required for APE1 degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation
revealed that APE1 interacted with Parkin in the presence of Pink1. These
results suggest that APE1 stability is dynamically regulated by Parkin in
the cytoplasm through the N-terminal APE1 domain.
