Title: New candidate oncogenes discovered in microsatellite unstable
colorectal cancer.


Around 15% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) show microsatellite instability
(MSI). A characteristic high passenger mutation load has discouraged
systematic mutation screens in MSI CRCs. To systematically search for
novel MSI CRC oncogenes, the exomes of 25 MSI CRC-normal pairs were
sequenced as the discovery set. Observed hot spots were confirmed by
Sanger sequencing and further validated in a set of 86 MSI CRCs.
Mutational hot spots were confirmed in 15 genes and three genes showed
additional hot spot mutations in the validation set. These three sites
were highly conserved across species. The hot spot sites of these three
genes were screened in 75 microsatellite stable CRCs and 12 MSI CRC cell
lines with negative results. Next, we analyzed the subcellular
localization of wild-type and mutant proteins. The findings of this study
support the idea that cancer genomes are heterogeneous and characterized
by few, frequently mutated mountains (e.g. BRAF and KRAS) and numerous,
less frequently mutated hills. The identified mutational hot spots may
prove important in developing personalized tumor profiling and therapy.
