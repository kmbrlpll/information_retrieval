Title: The difference of serum RNA profile: RNA extraction and detection
method.


Serum miRNA profiles are widely reported by many .research groups, but
they do not always coincide well. The reason of this difference is
suggested to be, at least in some cases, due to a difference in the RNA
extraction or detection method. In this report, we compare the miRNA
expression profiles of RNAs extracted from (1) extracellular vesicles
precipitated by ultra-centrifuging (2) precipitation of ExoQuick (3)
whole serum by QIAGEN miRNeasy (4) whole serum by Toray "3D-Gene" RNA
extraction reagent from liquid sample kit.In addition to this, the
comparison of data obtained by different detection tools will be also
shown. In these days, the whole miRNA expression profiling can be done by
multiple qRT-PCR, microarrays, and Next Generation Sequencing. However,
the feature of each method will reflect to the obtained data and it is no
surprise that data obtained by different tools do not match perfectly. We
will compare the serum miRNA expression profiles detected by (1) TaqMan
Array MicroRNA Card (2) QIAGEN miScript miRNA PCR Array (3) 3D-Gene Human
miRNA oligo chip, and discuss the base of method for serum miRNA
profiling.
