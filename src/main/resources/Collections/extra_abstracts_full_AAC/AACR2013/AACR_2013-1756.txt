Title: Intravital imaging of cancer cell cycle in the bone marrow.


The cell cycle of cancer cells in the bone marrow was imaged using a
fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI). With FUCCI,
quiescent cancer cells express mKusabira-Orange fluorescent protein (red)
and proliferating cells express mAzami-Green fluorescent protein (green).
FUCCI-expressing cancer cells were injected into the bone marrow of tibia
of mice. At the early stage after injection (7 days), approximately 90%
of the cells were in G0/G1. In contrast, at late stage after injection
(28 days more), in the endosteal lesion, approximately 80% of the cancer
cells were in S/G2/M phases and in the central zone, approximately 75% of
cancer cells were in G0/G1. Thus, cancer-cell location and time in the
bone marrow determines cell cycle position and possibly dormancy. Thus,
quiescent (dormant) cancer cells in the bone marrow need to be targeted
as well as proliferating cancer cells, which is a significant current
challenge.
