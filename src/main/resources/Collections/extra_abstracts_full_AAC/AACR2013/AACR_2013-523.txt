Title: Chaetoglobosin K inhibits VEGF expression in ovarian cancer cells.


Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer deaths for women in
America. In search for an effective reagent for prevention and treatment
of ovarian cancers, we looked into a mycotoxin, chaetoglobosin K (ChK),
and investigated its potential of angioprevention in two ovarian cancer
cell lines. Cell viability and necrosis were checked with MTS- and
LDH-based assays, respectively, and expression of several genes was
analyzed by ELISA or Western Blotting. We found this mycotoxin
dramatically toxic, sharply reducing cell viability at concentrations of
0.6 to 13 microM, and causing necrosis in both OVCAR-3 and A2780/CP70
cells at 2 microM. However, when applied at low concentrations (0.5 -2
microM), ChK effectively reduced expression of VEGF and HIF-1-alpha
proteins, and inhibited phosphorylation of Akt signaling molecules. While
further study on ChK is underway, we hypothesize a potential mycotoxin
for prevention and treatment of ovarian cancers.
