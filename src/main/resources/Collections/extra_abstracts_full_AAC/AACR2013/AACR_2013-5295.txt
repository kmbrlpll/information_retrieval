Title: Dysregulated miR-363 affects head and neck cancer invasion and
metastasis by targeting PDPN gene.


Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterised by an
elevated capacity for cell invasion and lymph node metastasis. The cause
remains to be determined. Recent studies suggest that microRNAs can
regulate the evolution of malignant behaviours by regulating multiple
target genes. In this study, we first confirmed that miR-363 is
down-regulated in HNSCC tissues with lymph node metastasis and cell lines
with highly invasive capacity. We also found that podoplanin (PDPN) is
up-regulated in the metastatic HNSCC tissues, and ectopic over-expression
of miR-363 suppressed the metastatic behaviour of HNSCC cells by directly
targeting PDPN. These data support a key role of miR-363-PDPN in head and
neck cancer metastasis by regulating cellular invasion and migration.
