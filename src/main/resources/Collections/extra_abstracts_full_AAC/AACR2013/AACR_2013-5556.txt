Title: Discovery of RKI-18, a small molecule that inhibits Rho kinases 1
and 2, migration and invasion of human tumors.


Signal transduction pathways that are mediated by ROCK1 and ROCK2 trigger
cell migration, invasion and metastasis. This prompted us to design and
synthesize novel Rho-kinase inhibitors (RKIs). Here, we show that one of
our most potent RKIs, RKI-18 (IC50 397 nM (ROCK1) and 349 nM (ROCK2)) but
not its inactive closely related analogue RKI-11 suppresses potently the
phosphorylation of the ROCK substrate MLC2 in intact human cancer cells.
Furthermore, RKI-18 is highly selective at inhibiting P-MLC2 over P-Akt,
P-S6 and P-Erk levels. RKI-18 suppresses ROCK-mediated actin fiber
formation following stimulation with LPA as well as PAK-mediated
lamelipodia and filopodia formation following bradykinin or PDGF
stimulation. Furthermore, RKI-18 but not RKI-11 inhibits migration,
invasion and anchorage-independent growth of human breast cancer cells.
The fact that RKI-18, the active ROCK inhibitor, but not RKI-11, its
inactive analogue, is effective at suppressing malignant transformation
suggests that preventing migration, invasion and anchorage-independent
growth with RKI-18 is likely due to inhibition of ROCK. Further advanced
preclinical studies are required to determine the potential of RKI-18 as
an anti-metastatic agent.
