Title: The role of ATF3 in arsenic-induced GADD45 expression.


GADD45 (growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 45), an effector of
G2/M checkpoint, is induced by trivalent arsenic (As3+) in human
bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B. In the present study, we
investigated the regulation of ATF3 (activating transcription factor 3)
on GADD45 with As 3+ treatment. We demonstrated that As3+ induced ATF3
expression, at both mRNA and protein level, and the induction was reduced
by p38 and JNK inhibition, but not affected by PI3K and ERK inhibition.
Luciferase assay also confirmed As3+ involvement in ATF3 transcriptional
regulation. Moreover, silencing of ATF3 downregulated As3+-induced
expression of GADD45 and chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that
ATF3 acted as an activator of GADD45 transcription in the presence of
As3+. Taken together, our data indicated that the increase of GADD45 in
response to As3+ was mediated by ATF3.
