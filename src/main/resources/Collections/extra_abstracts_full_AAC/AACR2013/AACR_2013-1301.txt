Title: Metformin induces cytotoxicity by TP and ERCC1 decrease.


Metformin is an anti-diabetic drug recently shown to inhibit cancer cell
proliferation and growth, although the involved molecular mechanisms have
not been elucidated. In many cancer cells, highly expression of thymidine
phosphorylase (TP) and ERCC1 are associated with poor prognosis. We used
A549 and H1975 huamn non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines to
investigate the role of TP and ERCC1 expression in metformin-induced
cytotoxicity. Metformin treatment decreased cellular TP and ERCC1 protein
and mRNA levels by down-regulating phosphorylated MEK1/2-ERK1/2 protein
levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The enforced expression of
the constitutively active MEK1 (MEK1-CA) vectors significantly restored
cellular TP and ERCC1 protein levels and cells viability. Specific
inhibition of TP and ERCC1 expression by siRNA enhanced the
metformin-induced cytotoxicity and growth inhibition. In conclusion,
metformin induces cytotoxicity by down-regulating TP and ERCC1 expression
in NSCLC cells.
