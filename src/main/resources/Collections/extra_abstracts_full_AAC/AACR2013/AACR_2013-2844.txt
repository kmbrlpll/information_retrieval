Title: ATATESTM activated the same patient's immune system to eliminate
hundreds of melanoma tumors for cure of cancer.


A 26 year old male melanoma cancer patient had over 1000 solid tumors
originated from a laser treatment of a mold on his back. Mutated cancer
cells metastasized to his lymph nodes first then spread to the skin all
around the body. He had symptoms of vomitting, poor apetide, loosing
weight and lack of strength for several months before seeking
BioMedicure's help. ATATESTMproducts, with antigenic material information
from millions of tumor cells preserving in spheres, were made out of his
melanoma tumors for immunotherapy over one month. His symptoms have been
reversed after a couple of months ATATESTM immunotherapy. Over 95% of his
melanoma tumors have been under control and disappearing over time.
Multiple death pathways elicited by ATATESTM have been observed and
investigated. The detailed mechanisms of action for ATATESTM will be
presented.Citation Format: Yong Qian. ATATESTM activated the same
