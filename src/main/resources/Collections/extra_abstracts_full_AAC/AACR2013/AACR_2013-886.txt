Title: OCT6 expression is associated with the resistance to cisplatin in
lung cancer.


Organic cation transporters (OCTs) of the solute carrier family 22 have
been identified as uptake transporters for the charge state of a
substrate such as cationic drugs. The OCTs have an isoform of OCT1, OCT2,
OCT3, and OCT6. Previously OCT1-3 have shown to related with
intracellular uptake of anticancer platinum drugs such as cisplatin
(CDDP) and oxaliplatin; however an association of OCT6 and platinum drugs
is not well elucidated. We found decreased gene and protein expressions
of OCT6 in CDDP resistant PC14/CDDP cells compared to those in parental
lung adenocaricinoma PC14 cells. In contrast, the expression levels of
OCT1-3 were not changed between PC14 and PC-14/CDDP cells. The
intracellular concentration of CDDP also decreased in PC14/CDDP compared
with the parental cell. To elucidate the OCT6 for uptake of CDDP, we
established a forced expression of OCT6 cell line by a transfection an
OCT6 vector to PC14/CDDP cells. We found that intracellular CDDP
concentration are increased concomitant with decreased resistance to CDDP
in OCT6 overexpressed PC14/CDDP cells. These results indicate that OCT6
is related with uptake of CDDP, and that the expression of OCT6 could be
one of the resistant factors against CDDP in lung cancer cells.
