Title: Human artificial chromosome (HAC) vector with a conditional
centromere for correction of human genetic deficiencies.


Human artificial chromosome (HAC)-based vectors offer a promising system
for delivery and expression of full-length human genes of any size. Due
to their unique maintenance features and unlimited cloning capacity, HACs
avoid the lack of copy number control and insertional mutagenesis caused
by integration into host chromosomes that plague viral vectors. We
previously described a synthetic HAC that can be easily eliminated from
cell populations by inactivation of its conditional kinetochore. Here, we
demonstrate the utility of this HAC, which has a unique gene acceptor
site, for delivery of full-length genes and correction of genetic
deficiencies in human cells. A battery of functional tests was performed
to demonstrate expression of NBS1 and VHL genes from the HAC at
physiological levels. We also show that phenotypes arising from stable
gene expression can be reversed when cells are cured of the HAC by
inactivating its kinetochore in proliferating cell populations, a feature
that provides a control for phenotypic changes attributed to expression
of HAC-encoded genes. This generation of human artificial chromosomes
should be suitable for studies of gene function and therapeutic
applications.
