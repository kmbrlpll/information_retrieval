Title: MSP58 regulates telomerase activity and cell proliferation via
interaction with TEIF.


Telomerase expression is essential for cell proliferation and survival,
which also plays a role in development, senescence and cancer. In our
previous studies, we demonstrated that ectopic expression MSP58 regulates
cell proliferation in context-dependent manner and induces premature
senescence in HT1080 cells and normal human diploid fibroblasts through
p53/p21 senescence pathway. In addition, we also demonstrated that MSP58
overexpression significantly suppressed telomerase activity in HT1080
cells. Currently, we identified a novel MSP58 interacting protein, TEIF
(Telomerase transcription element-interacting factor) by yeast-two hybrid
screening. TEIF has been reported to up-regulate the hTERT gene
expression and telomerase activity. Interestingly, we found that MSP58
represses the TEIF-mediated activation of telomerase. Furthermore,
overexpression of MSP58 represses TEIF promoted anchorage-independent
growth in HT1080 cells. In contrast, knockdown MSP58 expression increases
TEIF promoted anchorage -independent growth in HT1080 cells. These
results suggest that MSP58 regulates telomerase activity via interaction
with TEIF and contributes to control cell proliferation.
