Title: Dormant cancer cells are resistant to conventional therapies and
induce tumor vessels after chemotherapy.


Dormant cancer cells were visualized with a fluorescence ubiquitination
cell cycle indicator (FUCCI). FUCCI-expressing xenografts were
established from MKN45 gastric cancer cells. Within 7 days after
inoculation, FUCCI-expressing nascent tumors contained a mixture of
cancer cells in G0/G1 phase and in S/G2/M phases. Nascent tumors treated
with cyto-toxic agents showed that cancer cells in G0/G1 phase can
survive and become dormant. As tumors grew, the proliferating area was
only at the surface and the dormant area predominated. Chemotherapy
killed only the minority population of proliferating cancer cells at the
surface and had little effect on the majority of dormant cancer cells in
the tumor center. Furthermore, we investigated tumor chemoresistance
using nestin-driven GFP transgenic mice that have GFP-expressing nascent
tumor vessels. Chemotherapy-treated tumors had much more and deeper tumor
vessels than control tumors, suggesting that dormant cancer cells may
protect themselves by inducing tumor vessels. This report suggests that
dormant cancer cells play a large role in drug resistance.
