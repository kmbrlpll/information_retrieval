Title: Temozolomide-perillyl alcohol conjugate is cytotoxic for glioma
cancer stem cells.


Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most malignant glioma, is a highly
invasive tumor which is usually fatal within 2 years. The
chemotherapeutic agent of choice is temozolomide (TMZ); however glioma
patients inevitably become resistant to TMZ and tumors recur. Tumor
recurrence has been associated with highly invasive, chemoresistant
cancer stem cells (CSC) which is resistant to TMZ. We have constructed a
new chemical entity by conjugating TMZ to perillyl alcohol (POH) via a
carbamate bond. This compound, TMZ-POH, contains POH, a naturally
occurring monoterpene that reduces tumor cell migration and has
anti-tumor properties against gliomas as well as other cancers. In the
studies presented here we demonstrate that TMZ-POH is cytotoxic to CSCs
without affecting normal stem cells. The mechanism of TMZ-POH induced
cytotoxicity is mediated in part through the DNA damage response pathway
and apoptosis. Furthermore, the TMZ-POH conjugate is 5 to 10 fold more
effective in inducing cell death compared to TMZ, POH or the mixture of
these agents. Our data show that TMZ-POH is a promising novel compound
directed against cancer stem cells and therefore important for the
treatment of drug resistant, recurrent gliomas.
