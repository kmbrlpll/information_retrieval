Title: The LCBRN: a biospecimen resource for lung cancer biomarker and
discovery science.


The Lung Cancer Biospecimen Resource Network (LCBRN) is an open access
biorepository that obtains specimens from lung cancer patients (tissue,
blood, urine, bronchial lavage fluid and saliva) and makes them available
to biomedical researchers. Specimen collection is supported at 3
collection sites (Medical University of South Carolina, The University of
Virginia, and Washington University at St. Louis) in compliance with
uniform standard operating procedures. The specimens are annotated with
clinical, radiologic and pathologic data. Histologic and molecular
quality control procedures are in place for tissue samples. Lung cancer
and non-neoplastic lung tissue aliquots are processed into DNA, RNA and
protein fractions, which are also available. Fluid biosamples are
available from subjects prior to, and after surgery to remove the cancer.
A cohort of subjects are followed for recurrence with serial biofluid
sampling. Specimens are currently available from over 300 research
subjects. The application form for biospecimens and additional
information is available at http://LCBRN.org.
