Title: Analysis of CTCs enriched from whole blood samples of Breast, Lung
and Colorectal cancer patients with a flexible microspring array device.


The process by which metastatic cancers release cells that detach from a
primary tumor, spread through the circulatory system and invade distant
organs accounts for over 90% of cancer related deaths. A fundamental
challenge with analysis of these circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood
samples is the fact that they are so rare, with only a few tumors cells
occurring among billions of blood cells. We have developed a flexible
micro spring array (FMSA) that employs mechanical separation to
effectively enrich CTCs in a nondestructive manner that does not
compromise cell viability. The FMSA device geometric design and applied
filtration pressures have been optimized to maximize capture efficiency,
enrichment against leukocytes, and tumor cell viability. We have
successfully enriched and detected varying numbers of CTCs (min=1,
max=101) in 7.5mL whole blood samples obtained from Breast, Lung and
Colorectal cancer patients. CTCs were analyzed qualitatively and
quantitatively based on immunocytochemical determination of phenotype and
cell morphological characteristics. Aggregate clusters of cells were
observed in all assayed cancer types that comprised of multiple attached
CTCs (min=2, max=20) and occasionally leukocytes as well.
