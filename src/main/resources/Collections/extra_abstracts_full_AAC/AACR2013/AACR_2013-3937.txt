Title: Collagen prolyl hydroxylases are essential for breast cancer
metastasis.


Metastasis is the leading cause of death among patients who have breast
cancer. Understanding the role of the extracellular matrix in the
metastatic process may lead to the development of improved therapies to
treat cancer patients. Intratumoral hypoxia is found in the majority of
breast cancers and is associated with an increased risk of metastasis and
patient mortality. Here we demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor 1
activates the transcription of genes encoding collagen prolyl
hydroxylases that are critical for collagen deposition by breast cancer
cells. We show that expression of collagen prolyl hydroxylases promotes
cancer cell alignment along collagen fibers, resulting in enhanced cancer
cell invasion and metastasis to lymph nodes and lungs. We establish the
prognostic significance of collagen prolyl hydroxylase mRNA expression in
human breast cancer biopsies and evaluate the novel use of ethyl
3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, which decreases
tumor fibrosis and metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer.
