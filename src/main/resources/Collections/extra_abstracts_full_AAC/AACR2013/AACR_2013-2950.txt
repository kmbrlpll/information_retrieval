Title: Deletion of TRADD sensitizes oxidative stress-induced necrotic
cell death.


TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain (TRADD) is an essential mediator of
TNF receptor-1-mediated TNF signaling and is responsible for recruitment
of other effector proteins. Recruitment of these adaptor proteins leads
to the activation of MAP kinases and NF-kB, as well as cell death. it is
well known that aspect of ROS biological effects is their regulatory
roles on cell death to function as direct activator cell death or as
second messengers in the cell death processes. ROS may initiate cell
death processes through affecting various signaling cascade. Several
studies on the oxidative stress-induced cell death has shown that some of
the key TNF signaling molecules serve as the molecular targets of ROS in
cell death. However, there is no report concerning whether TRADD has a
function in oxidative stress-induced cell death. The availability of
TRADD deficiency mice let us investigate the physiological functions of
TRADD on oxidative stress-induce cell death. In this study, we found that
TRADD deficiency renders cells more susceptible to oxidative
stress-induced cell death through the persistent activation of JNK.
