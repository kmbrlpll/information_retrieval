Title: Fem1b attenuates the transcriptional activity of Gli1 by promoting
the ubiquitin mediated degradation of Gli1.


Gli1 is a member of the Gli family of zinc finger transcription factors
that functions in stem cell biology, and as an oncogene in malignant
transformation. The Hedgehog signaling pathway in flies and mammals
shares homology to the sex determination pathway of C. elegans in which
the Gli-like transcription factor TRA-1 is regulated by the ubiquitin
ligase adapter FEM-1. Here we provide evidence that the mammalian FEM-1
homolog Fem1b regulates Gli1 transcriptional activity. Consistent with
this, we demonstrate an interaction between Fem1b and Gli1, and show that
Fem1b promotes the ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of
Gli1. Fem1b mediated ubiquitylation of Gli1 was dependent on the VHL box
domain of Fem1b, shown to interact with Elongin B/C-Cul2-box protein
ubiquitin ligases. Fem1b reduced Gli1 transcriptional activity in a
reporter assay, and this reduction was also dependent on the VHL box of
Fem1b. Given that Gli1 up-regulation promotes tumorigenesis in
glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, and a variety of
epithelial malignancies, we hypothesize that Fem1b antagonizes the
oncogenic capacity of Gli1 by targeting Gli1 for ubiquitin-mediated
destruction in the proteasome.
