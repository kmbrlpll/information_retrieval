Title: Phase I clinical trial of Lenalidomide in combination with
Sorafenib in patients with advanced cancer.


Background: Preclinical data have shown that lenalidomide and sorafenib
target endothelial cells, inhibiting growth of ocular melanoma cells and
growth of tumors in a xenograft model (additive to synergistic
activity)(Mangiameli et al, J Transl Med 2007;5:38).Patients and Methods:
We conducted a phase 1 study in patients with advanced cancer. During the
escalation phase (3+3 design), lenalidomide (D1-21) and sorafenib (D1-28)
were given orally at the following respective daily doses: Level 1 (10mg,
200mg); Level 2 (10mg, 400mg); Level 3 (20mg, 400mg); and Level 4 (25mg,
400mg) (1 cycle=28 days).Results: Forty-one patients were treated [median
age: 50 yrs (16-72); men: 18 (44%); median no. of prior therapies: 3
(0-12); 2 metastatic sites: 80%]. The most common diagnoses were adenoid
cystic carcinoma (N=9), ovarian adenocarcinoma (N=7) and melanoma (N=6).
Overall, 140 cycles (median: 3; range, 1-17) were administered. No DLTs
were noted during the escalation phase (N=19) and Level 4 (lenalidomide
25 mg/day D1-21 and sorafenib 400mg/day Day 1-28), the maximum tested
dose was used in the expansion phase (N=22). Grade 3-4 treatment-related
toxicities were as follows: neutropenia (N=7; 17%), thrombocytopenia
(N=2; 5%), skin rash (N=2; 5%) and thromboembolism (N=2; 5%).
Thirty-eight patients were evaluable for response. Stable disease (SD)
was noted in 20 (53%) patients, including SD 6 months in 6 (16%). SD6
months by tumor type was as follows: ocular melanoma, 1/1 (100%); other
melanoma, 2/5 (40%); adenoid cystic carcinoma, 2/9 (22%); and ovarian
cancer, 1/5 (20%) (Table). The median progression-free survival (N=41)
was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.0-5.4) and median overall survival (N=41) was
12.3 months (95% CI, 10.1-14.5).Conclusions: Lenalidomide 25mg (D1-21)
combined with sorafenib 400 mg (D1-28) was well tolerated and it was
associated with disease stabilization for 6 months in selected patients
with melanoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma and ovarian adenocarcinoma.
