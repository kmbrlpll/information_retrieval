Title: Gelfoam histoculture enables cancer cells to mimic in vivo cell
cycle behavior.


Tumors in vivo are well known to behave quite differently from cancer
cells cultured on plastic or glass plates (monolayer culture). Therefore,
cancer cell-cycle kinetics were visualized in Gelfoam 3D-histoculture
using HeLa cells and MKN45 cells expressing fluorescence ubiquitination
cell cycle indicator (FUCCI), whereby quiescent cancer cells express
mKusabira-Orange fluorescent protein (red) and proliferating cells
express mAzami-Green fluorescent protein (green). Gelfoam histoculture of
FUCCI-expressing cancer cells results in tumor-like structures with
quiescent cancer cells in the center and proliferating cells at the
surface, similar to what occurs in vivo as visualized by FUCCI confocal
microscopy. These results have profound implications for cell cycle
studies, since most cellular and molecular studies of the cancer cell
cycle are performed on plastic monolayer culture where characteristics of
the cells may be quite different from the tumor in vivo.
