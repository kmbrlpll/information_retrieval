Title: Developmental checkpoint function of 40p53.


40p53, an N-terminally truncated p53 isoform, is predominantly expressed
in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and during early post-implantation
embryogenesis in the mouse. We have discovered that 40p53 controls the
switch from pluripotency to differentiation by regulating IGF signaling
in ESCs. Our studies revealed this isoform of p53 inhibits retinoic
acid-induced differentiation and subsequent epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). As ESCs differentiate, 40p53 cannot activate the
expression of some important developmental genes, such as p21, FGF10,
DKK1, lamin A and ZO-1, coincident with decreasing Erk signaling and an
enhanced Wnt/-catenin pathway. ChIP assays suggested that p21, FGF10 and
ZO-1 are inhibited at the elongation step. To distinguish between the
transcription regulation functions of full-length p53 and 40p53, we
generated stable HeLa cell lines transfected with Flag-tagged p53 and
40p53. qPCR and ChIP assays confirmed that 40p53, but not full-length
p53, represses gene elongation, with a concomitant decrease in
acetylation of histone H4 and H3 in the promoter region. Our studies
reveal that 40p53, but not p53, is able to block ESC differentiation by
regulation of specific gene expression at the elongation step during
mouse development.
