Title: Generation and characterization of highly selective cathepsin S
inhibitors with potentials against pancreatic cancer.


Cathepsin S (CTSS) is a critical cellular protease required for cancer
development and metastasis. This proteolytic enzyme is often
over-expressed by malignant tumor cells and secreted into the
extracellular milieu to degrade surrounding matrix components. Here, we
attempted to systematically generate and evaluate potential CTSS
inhibitors in hope to identify potent candidates for use as antitumor
agents. Detailed kinetic analysis revealed several lead compounds possess
very low Ki values and high specificity against target CTSS protease.
Results from ECM degradation assays demonstrated that these small
molecules could protect fibronectin from CTSS-mediated degradation and
consequently hinder tumor cell movement. Treating various pancreatic
tumor cell lines with these CTSS inhibitors further resulted in a drastic
decrease in cell migration and invasion. The test compounds also reduced
the spread of pancreatic tumor cells in orthotopic animal model and thus
prolonged mice survival. Finally, these lead molecules exhibited
reasonable pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, suggesting their potential as
antitumor agents against pancreatic cancer.
