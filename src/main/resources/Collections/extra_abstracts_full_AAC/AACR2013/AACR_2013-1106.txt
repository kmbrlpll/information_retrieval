Title: Mechanism for activation of mutated EGF receptors in lung cancer.


Previous studies have demonstrated that wild-type (WT) EGFRs are
activated by an allosteric mechanism in which a donor tyrosine kinase
domain (TKD) monomer contacts an acceptor TKD monomer, leading to its
activation. Here, we present biochemical reconstitution data
demonstrating that receptor activation by the most frequently occurring
EGFR mutations found in lung cancer does not adhere to this mechanism.
Mutated EGFRs hyperphosphorylate their WT counterparts and appear to
adopt a conformation that allows them to function as acceptors but not as
donors to WT EGFR. As acceptors, the mutated EGFRs also show enhanced
association with WT EGFR. We suggest the term superacceptor activity to
describe this directionally-limited mutant-specific mechanism of EGFR
transactivation. Mutated EGFRs also hyperphosphorylate the related ErbB
family member, ErbB-2, in a similar manner. Collectively, these data
provide insights into a mechanism for activation of lung
cancer-associated mutant EGFRs. Since WT EGFRs are usually present in
EGFR mutant tumor cells, our studies additionally argue that WT EGFRs
contribute to tumorigenesis and may alter sensitivity to EGFR-targeted
therapy.
