Title: Extracellular protons promote the metastasis of breast cancer via
activation of the proton-sensing receptor G-protein coupled receptor 4.


Acidosis of the tumor microenvironment is a typical malignant phenotype
that enhances tumorigenesis and tumor progression induced by altered
cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation. However, the
underlying mechanism by which tumor cells sense and response the acidic
environment remains unclear. In this study, we found that expression of
G-protein coupled receptor (GPR4) was upregulated in breast cancer cells
and tissues from patients with breast cancer compared to normal breast
cells and tissues. In a xenograft mouse model, short hairpin RNA
(shRNA)-mediated silencing of endogenous GPR4 significantly reduced
distant metastases to several lymph nodes and the lung compared to
control shRNA. In addition, endogenous GPR4 expression in breast cancer
cells enhanced tumor cell migration and invasion in an acidic environment
and induced the activation of RhoA and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) pathway. Acidosis/GPR4 activation also upregulated the
expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) in breast cancer cells. These findings highlight a
novel mechanism by which acidosis-mediated tumor aggressiveness is
acquired as a critical step for distant metastasis in breast cancer.
