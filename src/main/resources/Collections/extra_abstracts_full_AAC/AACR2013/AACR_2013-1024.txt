Title: Therapeutic efficacy of RNA interference targeting focal adhesion
kinase against orthotropic xenograft of human malignant pleural
mesothelioma in SCID mice.


Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive neop lasm of the
pleura. The prognosis for MPM remains disappointing, although there have
been some improvements in prognosis from newer chemotherapies and
multimodality treatments. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an important
regulator of cellular signaling, migration, apoptosis, and cell cycle
progression. We tested the hypothesis that FAK plays an important role in
the pathogenesis of MPM and examined the effect of inhibiting FAK
expression of MPM using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in vitro and in
vivo. FAK expression was evaluated by Western and Northern blots.
Knockdown of FAK resulted in detachment and proliferation inhibition of
MPM cells in vitro. We assessed the therapeutic applicability of FAK
siRNA in orthotopic xenograft model in SCID mice. FAK siRNA treatment
inhibited the growth of MPM tumors and production of pleural effusion.
These findings suggest that FAK may be a potential therapeutic target for
human MPM and exogenous delivery of siRNA targeting FAK may be a useful
strategy for MPM therapy.
