Title: Role of FAM3B as a novel tumor suppressor gene in gastric cancer.


PANcreatic-DERived factor (PANDER, FAM3B) is a member of the FAM3 family
of cytokine molecules. FAM3B expression is originally identified in the
endocrine pancreas and also expressed in in colon and stomach. Initial
characterization of FAM3B revealed a potential role in pancreatic islet
apoptosis. However, the biological function of FAM3B has still remained
elusive. Here we show that FAM3B level is decreased in 11 out of 14
cancer tissues samples (78.5%) as well as in gastric cancer cell lines.
Ectopic expression of FAM3B leads to inhibition of cell growth and
reduction of single cell colony forming activity and tumorigenicity of
gastric cancer cells. FAM3B not only induces reduction of AKT
phosphorylation, which is involved in cell survival, but also
upregulation of p21, an inhibitor of cell cycle progression. We also
demonstrated that FAM3B gene is silenced by epigenetic modification in
gastric cancer cell lines. MS-275, a synthetic inhibitor of histone
deacetylase, induced FAM3B gene expression. In conclusion, our data
suggest the role of FAM3B as a putative tumor suppressor through
downregulation of oncogenic AKT signaling pathway in gastric cancer.
