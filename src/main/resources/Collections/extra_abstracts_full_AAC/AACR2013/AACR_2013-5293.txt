Title: Prognostic significance of miR-194 in endometrial cancer.


Endometrial cancer (EC) is the leading malignant tumor occurring in the
female genital tract and some subtypes are highly invasive and
metastatic. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that have a broad impact on
cancer progression. In particular, miR-194 regulates epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing the expression of BMI-1 in
EC. In this retrospective study, the clinical significance of miR-194 was
investigated in archival EC specimens. We extracted total RNA from
thirty-two EC samples and quantified the expression level of miR-194. We
discovered that the expression level of miR-194 was significantly (P =
0.03) lower in type I EC patients with more advanced stage. In addition,
patients with higher miR-194 levels have better prognosis than those with
lower miR-194 levels (P = 0.0067; Cut-off value of miR-194 = 0.3). These
results indicate that miR-194 has potential to serve as prognostic
biomarker for EC patients.
