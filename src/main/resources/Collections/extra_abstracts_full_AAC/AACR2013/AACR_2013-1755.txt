Title: Invasive cancer cells are mostly in the G0/G1 phase of the cell
cycle.


Invasive cancer cells are a critical target for chemotherapy. However,
the cell cycle phase of invasive cancer cells is poorly understood.
Cancer cells were cultured in 3D Gelfoam culture where they have in
vivo-like cell cycle kinetics. Cancer cell-cycle kinetics were visualized
using a fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI), whereby
quiescent cancer cells express mKusabira-Orange fluorescent protein (red)
and proliferating cells express mAzami-Green fluorescent protein (green).
Real-time imaging demonstrated that cancer cells in the G0/G1 phase are
invasive and disseminate in Gelfoam histoculture. Moreover, in vivo,
FUCCI-expressing cancer cells were in G0/G1 phase when they metastasized
to the liver. Disseminated cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity were
also in G0/G1 phase. Most drugs currently in use target cells in S/G2/M
are therefore may not be able to target invasive cancer cells.
Color-coded cell-cycle imaging of cancer cell invasion should provide a
novel platform for the rapid screening of candidate therapeutic agents
against quiescent, invasive cancer cells.
