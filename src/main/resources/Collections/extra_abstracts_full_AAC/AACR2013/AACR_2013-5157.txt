Title: Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of AKT by NEDD4-1.


Several E3 ligases have been reported to regulate AKT stability and
activation through ubiquitination. We found that NEDD4-1 is a novel E3
ligase involved in ubiquitin-dependent regulation of AKT. NEDD4-1
physically interacts with AKT and mediates AKT ubiquitination in vitro
and in vivo. NEDD4-1 catalyzes K63-type polyubiquitin chain formation on
AKT in an in vitro ubiquitination assay. AKT ubiquitination by NEDD4-1 in
vivo requires plasma membrane binding but not phosphorylation of AKT.
Ubiquitination of AKT or pAKT by NEDD4-1 promotes AKT nucleus-oriented
translocation. IGF-1 signaling stimulates NEDD4-1-mediated ubiquitination
of pAKT but not total AKT. A cancer-derived plasma membrane-philic mutant
AKT(E17K) is more effectively ubiquitinated by NEDD4-1 and more
efficiently trafficked into the nucleus compared with AKT. This study
revealed a novel function of AKT ubiquitination by NEDD4-1 in its nuclear
trafficking, a step that contributes to AKT activation process in IGF-1
response.
