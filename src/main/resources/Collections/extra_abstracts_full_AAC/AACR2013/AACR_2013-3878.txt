Title: Bach1 promotes liver metastasis of colorectal cancer cells by
regulating c-Myc and SOX4.


Bach1 is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that binds to Maf
recognition elements (MAREs) and has recently been identified as the
regulator of breast cancer metastasis. Bach1 promotes breast cancer
metastasis to bone by directly upregulating MMP1 and CXCR4 and it is
critical for the cell transformation and tumor growth induced by
activated H-RasV12. Here, we demonstrate the oncogenic mechanisms of
Bach1 in colorectal cancer. Ectopic expression of Bach1 increases
invasion of colorectal cancer cells, whereas knockdown of Bach1
significantly reduces the invasive efficiency of the cancer cells. In a
mouse model, suppression of Bach1 expression significantly inhibits
intravasation and liver metastasis of colorectal cancer cells. The
mechanism involves upregulation of c-Myc and SOX4 expression by Bach1
maintaining ERK signaling. Finally, we confirmed the expression of Bach1
is high in the patient samples of colorectal cancer and metastasis,
unlike normal colon tissues. These results suggest Bach1 as a novel
target for cancer therapeutic strategy.
