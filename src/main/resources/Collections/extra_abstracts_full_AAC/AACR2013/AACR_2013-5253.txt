Title: SOX2-mediated cell survival and chemoresistance in lung cancer.


Tumor cells have long been observed to share several biological
characteristics with normal stem/progenitor cells; however, the oncogenic
mechanisms underlying the stemness features remain elusive. Here we
report the involvement of BCL2L1 in SOX2-mediated cell survival and
chemoresistance in lung cancer. SOX2 was associated with poor prognosis
in lung cancer patients and was expressed in a subclass of lung cancer
cells the survival and chemoresistance of which were dependent on SOX2
stem cell signaling. SOX2 promoted chemoresistance, and silencing of SOX2
perturbed mitochondrial function, causing marked apoptosis and autophagy.
Moreover, SOX2 knockdown attenuated tumor growth in a xenograft mouse
model. SOX2 induced BCL2L1 expression, the ectopic expression of which
rescued the effects of SOX2 silencing on apoptosis, autophagy, and
mitochondrial function. SOX2 and BCL2L1 expression levels were
significantly correlated in human lung tumors, supporting the involvement
of BCL2L1 in SOX2-mediated oncogenesis. Our findings reveal for the first
time that SOX2-BCL2L1 signaling maintains mitochondrial integrity and
enhances cell survival, leading to increased chemoresistance in lung
cancer cells.
