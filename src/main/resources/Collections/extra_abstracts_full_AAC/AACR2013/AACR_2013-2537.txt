Title: Infectious, autoimmune, and allergic diseases and risk of Hodgkin
lymphoma in children and adolescents: A Children's Oncology Group (COG)
study.


Relatively little research has been devoted to understanding the causes
of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in children. HL diagnosed at 1 year prior to HL
diagnosis, and EBV+ cases were more likely to report prior sore throats
(including strep throat, scarlet fever, tonsillitis; OR=2.19, 95% CI:
1.06-4.53) and infectious mononucleosis (OR=9.10, 95% CI: 0.81-102.3).
Case siblings were also more likely to have had an infection prior to HL
diagnosis (OR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.01-4.14). In index children, autoimmune
(OR=0.46, 95% CI: 0.16-1.38) and allergic (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 0.93-1.59)
diseases identified >1 year before HL diagnosis were not associated with
HL overall or by EBV status or subtype. There were no notable
associations for autoimmune or allergic diseases in parents or siblings.
These results may indicate a true increased risk for infections and lack
of association with history of conditions imparting immune dysregulation,
or they may be attributable to inaccurate recall. Future studies should
employ biomarkers to understand differences in immune function preceding
pediatric HL.Supported by NIH Grants R01 CA047473 and K05 CA157439, and
