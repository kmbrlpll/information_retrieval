Title: p53 promotes repair of heterochromatin DNA by regulating JMJD2b
and SUV39H1 expression.


Constitutive heterochromatin is important for maintaining chromosome
stability but also delays the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB).
DSB repair in complex mammalian genomes involves a fast phase (2-6 hrs)
where most of the breaks are rapidly repaired, and a slow phase (up to 24
hrs) where the remaining damages in heterochromatin are repaired. We
found that p53 deficiency delays the slow phase DNA repair after ionizing
irradiation. P53 deficiency prevents down regulation of histone H3K9
trimethylation at pericentric heterochromatin after DNA damage. Moreover,
p53 directly induces expression of the H3 K9 demethylase JMJD2b through
promoter binding. P53 activation also indirectly down regulates
expression of the H3 K9 methytransferase SUV39H1. Depletion of JMJD2b or
sustained expression of SUV39H1 delays the repair of heterochromatin DNA
and reduces clonogenic survival after ionizing irradiation. The results
suggest that by regulating JMJD2b and SUV39H1 expression, p53 not only
controls transcription but also promotes heterochromatin relaxation to
accelerate a rate-limiting step in the repair of complex genomes.
