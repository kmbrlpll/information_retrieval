Title: Traditional Chinese medicine formula LQ inhibits spontaneous and
cyclophosphamide-enhanced metastasis.


TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) formula LQ, an herbal cocktail, has
shown anti-metastasis and anti-tumor efficacy without overt side-effects.
In the present study, the human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line was labeled
with both red fluorescent protein (RFP) in the cytoplasm and green
fluorescent protein (GFP) in the nucleus. Dual-color HT1080 cells were
injected into the footpad of mice following LQ treatment. Dual-color
HT1080 cells were also injected into epigastric cranialis vein of the
mice pre-treated with cyclophosphamide (CYC) or a combination of CYC and
LQ. The efficacy was monitored through dynamic subcellular imaging of
trafficking of cancer cells in lymph nodes and blood vessels in live
mice. LQ significantly inhibited HT1080 spontaneous metastases to their
local lymph nodes in the foot pad injection model. In the control group,
100% of mice had lymph node metastasis, compared to 12.5% of the mice in
the LQ group. LQ also inhibited cyclophosphamide-enhanced experimental
metastasis in the epigastric cranialis vein injection model. LQ prolonged
the overall survival of mice in the spontaneous lymph node metastatic
model. LQ therefore shows promise as an antimetastatic agent.
