Title: Investigating the role of CDC25B in inhibition of cellular
proliferation.


CDC25B is a dual specificity phosphatase that activates cyclin-dependent
kinases to trigger entry into mitosis. Overexpression of CDC25B has been
associated with breast and head and neck cancers as well as higher
histological tumor grade in non-small cell lung cancers. In a transgenic
mouse model, overexpression of Cdc25B in the mammary glands lead to
accelerated mammary epithelial proliferation resulting in hyperplasia
while in vitro, co-transfection of CDC25B with Ras allows for
transformation of MEF's. However, in vitro experiments using ectopic
expression of CDC25B in transformed cell lines have shown an
anti-proliferative effect. This may be related to inappropriate
cyclin-dependent kinase activation and premature mitotic entry, leading
to both p53-dependent and independent checkpoints. In addition, S phase
cells overexpressing CDC25B have higher rates of apoptosis due to
premature entry into mitosis. CDC25B has also been shown to cause an
early progression to S phase that is associated with increased amounts of
DNA damage. Our goal is to expand on these results to further clarify the
anti-proliferative effects of CDC25B as well as detail the mechanism by
which tumor cells bypass these effects in vitro and in vivo.
