Title: MicroRNA-30c targets cytoskeleton genes involved in breast cancer
cell invasion.


Metastasis remains a significant challenge in treating cancer. MicroRNAs
have emerged as important epigenetic regulators of various cellular
processes during cancer development and progression. The goal of this
study was to characterize signaling pathways for miRNA biomarkers that
regulate breast cancer metastasis. Here we show that human breast tumor
biomarker miR-30c regulates invasion by targeting the cytoskeleton
network genes encoding Twinfilin 1 (TWF1) and Vimentin (VIM). Both VIM
and TWF1 have been shown to regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). Similar to TWF1, VIM also regulates F-actin formation, a key
component of cellular transition to a more invasive mesenchymal
phenotype. To further characterize the role of the TWF1 pathway in breast
cancer, we found that IL-11 is an important target of TWF1 that regulates
breast cancer cell invasion and STAT3 phosphorylation. This miR-30c
VIM/TWF1-IL11-pSTAT3 pathway will expedite the development of targeting
strategies to prevent and treat breast tumor progression.
