Title: Development of a novel circulating tumor cell technology for
cancer predictive biomarker analysis.


Circulation tumor cells are critically important to understand tumor
metastasis and may have a potential to noninvasively evaluate the cancer
for clinical management. The isolation and characterization of CTC
represent a major technological challenge. While the CellSeach system by
J&J has shown that CTC enumeration can be an independent predictor of
survival for breast, prostate and colon cancer, little molecular
information can be obtained from the CTC to have an impact on patient
management or clinical outcome. Most hormone dependent
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) becomes refractory after one
to three years of treatment, many through the amplification or mutation
of the androgen receptor gene. As multiple targeted agents become
available for this cancer and no tumor material can be obtained due to
bone metastasis, there is an urgent need to be able to evaluate
biomarkers of CRPC for clinical management of the patients. In order to
assess biomarkers that may influence the management of CRPC, we worked on
a novel antibody-independent CTC purification technology for isolation of
Live CTC from CRPC.
