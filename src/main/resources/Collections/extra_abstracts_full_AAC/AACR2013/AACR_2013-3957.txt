Title: Cardiac metastasis in mice with primary breast carcinoma.


The incidence of cardiac metastases reported in the literature ranges
from 2.3% to 18.3%. Cancer cells invade the heart either directly or
through the blood stream or lymphatics. This report describes cardiac
metastasis from primary breast carcinoma in an orthotopic nude mouse
model. 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells expressing FP were orthotopically
implanted into the right second mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice. When the
average tumor volume reached approximate 500-600 mm3, the 4T1 primary
tumors were removed at approximately day-18 after tumor implantation. At
autopsy, 2 of 12 mice were found to have metastasized to the heart, as
brightly visualized by RFP fluorescence, when the mice were sacrificed
6-8 weeks after cell implantation. Post-mortem histological and frozen
sample sections showed extensive tumor infiltration into the pericardium,
epicardium, and myocardium. The novel mouse model of cardiac metastasis
can be used to screen for effective agents.
