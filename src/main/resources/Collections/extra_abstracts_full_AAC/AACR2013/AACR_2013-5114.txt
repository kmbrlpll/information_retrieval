Title: Multi-organ metastatic capability of 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells
after surgical resection of primary orthotopic tumor.


We report an optically imageable orthotopic metastatic syngeneic model of
4T1 mouse breast cancer expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP). 4T1
cells, expressing RFP, were injected orthotopically into the right second
mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice. The primary tumor was removed on day-18
after tumor implantation, when the average tumor volume reached
approximate 500-600 mm3. At autopsy, the 4T1-RFP was found to have
metastasized to numerous organs, when the mice were sacrificed 6-8 weeks
after cell implantation, including the lung in 91% of the animals, the
lymph nodes in 100% of the animals including axillary nodes, the liver in
91% of the animals, the bone in 42% of the animals and the brain in 25%
of the animal. Detailed fluorescence analysis visualized extensive
metastasis in the thoracic cavity and the lymphatic system. Large
metastatic nodules in the lung involved most of the pulmonary parenchyma
in all lobes. Lymph node metastasis was found mainly in the axillary
area. In the liver, fluorescent macroscopic metastatic nodules were found
under the capsule. The metastatic pattern in the model thus reflected
clinical highly metastatic breast cancer and enables drug discovery for
this disease.
