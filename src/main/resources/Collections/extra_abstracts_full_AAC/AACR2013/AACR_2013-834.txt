Title: NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) stabilization of C/EBP against
20S proteasomal degradation leads to protection against radiation-induced
myeloproliferative diseases.


NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) is a flavoprotein that protects cells
against radiation and chemical induced oxidative stress. Disruption of
NQO2 gene in mice leads to -radiation-induced myeloproliferative
diseases. In this report, we found that NQO2 in presence of its cofactor
NRH protected C/EBP against 20S degradation. Coimmunoprecipitation
studies showed that 20S proteasome and NQO2 both interact with myeloid
differentiation factor C/EBP. 20S proteasome interaction with C/EBP led
to the degradation of C/EBP. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis
demonstrated that NQO2 and 20S competed for the same binding region of
S(268)GAGAGKAKKSV(279) in C/EBP. Exposure of mice and HL-60 cells to
-radiation enhanced the levels of NQO2, which led to increased NQO2
interaction with C/EBP and decreased 20S interaction with C/EBP. This
resulted in the stabilization of C/EBP and protection against
-radiation-induced myeloproliferative diseases. NQO2-/- mice deficient in
NQO2 failed to stabilize C/EBP. This contributed to the development of
-radiation-induced myeoproliferative disease in NQO2-/- mice.
