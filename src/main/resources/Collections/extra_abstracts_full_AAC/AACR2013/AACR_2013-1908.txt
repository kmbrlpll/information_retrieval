Title: 19q13.2 amplification occurs in a subset of SMAD4-deficient
pancreatic cancers.


Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal disease. The
PDAC genomes show evidence of high genomic instability leading to complex
genomic rearrangements and copy number alterations. Major genetic events
involved in PDAC progression have been characterized, but the subsequent
alterations that contribute to different tumor behavior or patient
outcomes are not well understood. Smad4 tumor suppressor gene mutation or
deletion in pancreatic cancer correlates with metastatic disease and
poorer patient outcome. We found that in a subset of PDACs with Smad4
expression loss, the chromosomal region 19q13.2 is focally amplified.
Genomic amplifications found in cancers have been shown to contain driver
genes that contribute to tumorigenesis. We are currently investigating
the contribution of 19q13.2 amplicon resident genes in pancreatic cancer
cell growth. Our characterization of a cancer amplicon in relation to
known major genetic events in pancreatic cancer revealed that the 19q13.2
amplicon is closely associated with a subset of SMAD4-deficient tumors.
Through additional in-depth tumor analyses we may better understand the
heterogeneity and complexity of PDAC biology.
