Title: Phosphatidylserine-targeting betabodies for the treatment of
cancer.


Bavituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that is being combined with
chemotherapy to treat patients with lung or pancreatic cancer in
randomized Phase II clinical trials. Bavituximab targets the
immunosuppressive lipid, phosphatidylserine (PS), which becomes exposed
on the outer membrane surface of tumor blood vessels and tumor cells in
tumors responding to therapy. The antibody acts by destroying tumor
vasculature and by reactivating tumor immunity. Here, we generated new
PS-targeting therapeutics by fusing domains of the PS-binding plasma
protein, mouse 2-glycoprotein I (2GP1), to the Fc region of mouse IgG2a.
Such betabodies potentially have the following advantages: they bind
directly to PS, and do not require a cofactor protein (2GP1) for binding;
they can be made fully human; they are smaller in size (100 KDa); and
they have slower blood clearance rates. A construct was generated that
bound strongly to PS-expressing cells and plates, localized to tumor
vascular endothelium in vivo, and had a -phase blood half-life of
approximately five days after intravenous injection into mice as compared
with one day for a murine version of bavituximab, 2aG4. Betabodies could
potentially be the next generation of PS-targeting cancer therapeutics.
