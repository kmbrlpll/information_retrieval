Title: A novel function of p21 in inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition through microRNAs.


The tumor suppressor p21 inhibits cell proliferation during the stress
response. However, p21 can also directly regulate gene expression by
repressing specific transcription factors. Here, we identified
p21-regulated miRNAs by sequencing small RNAs from HCT116-p21+/+ and
HCT116-p21-/- cells. Three abundant clusters, miR-200b-200a-429,
miR-200c-141 and miR-183-96-182 were down-regulated in p21-depleted
HCT116 and MCF10A cells. Loss of p21 induced epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and enhanced migration and invasion in multiple model
systems. Identification of genome-wide targets of the miR-183-96-182
cluster indicated that miR-183 and miR-96 repressed common targets,
including SLUG, ZEB1, ITGB1 and KLF4, to inhibit EMT, migration and
invasion. In turn, elevated ZEB1 levels in HCT116-p21-/- cells directly
repressed miR-183-96-182 cluster transcription, revealing a feedback
loop. Re-introduction of miR-200, miR-183 or miR-96 in HCT116-p21-/-
cells inhibited migration and invasion. These novel findings suggest that
coordinated down-regulation of three miRNA clusters upon loss of p21 in
unstressed cells promotes EMT, migration and invasion.
