Title: Elucidating the role of ARID3B in ovarian cancer stem cells.


Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among US women
and accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of gynecological
origin. In light of the lethality, it is critical to discover and
understand the common molecular characteristics in ovarian cancer. Our
lab demonstrated that ARID3B, a member of the AT-rich interactive domain
family of proteins, is overexpressed in ovarian cancer. Furthermore,
ARID3B is essential for embryonic development and is present in embryonic
stem cells. Overexpression of ARID3B in ovarian cancer cells leads to
increased tumor growth and decreased survival in xenograft studies.
Therefore, we hypothesize that ARID3B regulates cancer stem cell
production, which enhances tumorigenesis. We have found that stem-cell
marker CD133 is upregulated in ovarian cancer human cell line SKOV3IP
overexpressing ARID3B. We are currently assessing the mechanism for
ARID3B regulation of ovarian cancer stem cells using in vitro models.
Determining the role of ARID3B in cancer stem cells may help us better
understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate tumor initiation,
chemoresistance, and ovarian cancer progression.
