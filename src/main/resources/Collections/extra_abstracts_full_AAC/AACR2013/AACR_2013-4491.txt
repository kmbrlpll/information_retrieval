Title: Discovery of potent small molecular tubulin inhibitors for the
treatment of cancer.


Microtubule is a well-established drug target for the treatment of
cancer. Drugs acting at this target include paclitaxel and docetaxel that
stabilize the microtubules and prevent cancer cells from going through
mitosis. These drugs are very successful chemotherapy agents and widely
used for the treatment of cancer. In this presentation, we report the
discovery of several series of novel and potent small molecular tubulin
inhibitors and the identification of IMP03138 as a preclinical candidate.
IMP03138 has advantages over the most commonly used anti-cancer drug
paclitaxel in several in vitro assays and in vivo efficacy studies.
Importantly, IMP03138 is highly effective against multi-drug resistant
cancer cells. IMP3138 is currently undergoing IND enabling studies.
