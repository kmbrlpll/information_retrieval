Title: Development of pyrrolobenzodiazepine-based antibody-drug
conjugates for cancer.


Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers are highly cytotoxic minor groove
binding DNA crosslinking agents derived from the anthramycin class of
natural products. In our efforts to develop highly effective and
well-tolerated treatment options for cancer patients, we have
investigated several antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) based on a PBD
dimer. The fully synthetic PBD-linker, comprised of a protease-cleavable
val-ala sequence and a reactive maleimide group, was conjugated via
engineered cysteine residues to humanized monoclonal antibodies specific
for their binding to the well-characterized cancer antigen targets, CD33
and CD70. The resulting ADCs were well-defined, monomeric and showed
pronounced in vitro and in vivo activity against both hematologic and
solid tumor cancer models. These included models of acute myelogenous
leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and renal cell
carcinoma. The ADCs were immunologically specific, and showed potent
activity in MDR-positive models, including models resistant to other
ADCs. These results underscore the importance of the drug component in
developing highly efficacious ADCs for cancer therapy.
