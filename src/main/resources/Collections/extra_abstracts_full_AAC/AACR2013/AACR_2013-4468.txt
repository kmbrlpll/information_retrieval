Title: Cripto-1 elicits innate resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small
cell lung cancer harboring EGFR-sensitizing mutations.


Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carrying sensitizing epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) mutations can initially benefit from erlotinib
(EGFR inhibitor) treatment. However, patients invariably develop
resistance through secondary EGFR mutations, c-MET amplification,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), small cell lung cancer
transformation, PIK3CA mutation and other unknown mechanisms. Here we
examined whether Cripto1, which has been shown to induce EMT, could cause
erlotinib resistance. We show that innate erlotinib-resistant lung
adenocarcinomas carrying sensitizing EGFR mutations exhibit higher level
of Cripto1 expression than their erlotinib sensitive counterparts.
Ectopic expression of Cripto1 rendered erlotinib-sensitive lung
adenocarcinoma cells resistant to erlotinib both in vitro and in a
xenograft model. Moreover, Cripto1 activated Zeb1/EMT signaling pathway
in EGFR-TKI resistant cells. High Cripto1 expression correlated with poor
prognosis of NSCLC patients. Our study provides a novel Cripto1-dependent
mechanism of EGFR-TKI resistance that may pave the way for the
development of therapies to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance in lung cancer
patients.
