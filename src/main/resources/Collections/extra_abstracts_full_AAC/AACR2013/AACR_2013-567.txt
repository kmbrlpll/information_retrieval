Title: Dual functions of Mad1 in mitosis and DNA damage response.


The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and the DNA damage checkpoint are
two evolutionarily conserved mechanisms by which the fidelity of
chromosome segregation in response to various DNA lesions is protected.
These checkpoints are believed to function independently. However, there
is growing evidence showing that proteins involved in the two systems
have overlapping functions. Here we show that the mitotic
arrest-deficient protein 1 (Mad1), a critical component of the SAC, is
also required for the DNA damage response (DDR). We found that depletion
of Mad1 led to cellular hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) and
prolonged persistence of the H2AX foci. Interestingly, we observed Mad1
to be hyperphosphorylated both in mitosis and in response to DNA damage
induced by IR in an ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) dependent manner.
ATM is an essential DDR kinase which is also activated in mitosis and
required for the SAC. We found that ATM phosphorylated Mad1 on Serine 214
both in vitro and in-cell. We further demonstrated that ATM-mediated Mad1
Serine 214 phosphorylation was required for both SAC and optimal DDR.
Collectively, these findings reveal the dual function of ATM-mediated
Mad1 phosphorylation in mitosis and DDR.
