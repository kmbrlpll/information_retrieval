Title: Smad4 loss leads to reduced DNA repair and skin cancer.


Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the primary cause of skin cancer.
Non-melanoma skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), is the most common form of skin cancer and
accounts for 2-3 million worldwide cases of cancer each year. The
transcription factor Smad4 is a central mediator in the transforming
growth factor (TGF), activin, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
signaling pathways. Smad4 loss occurs frequently in human skin squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC), but it is unknown if this event is causal to
ultraviolet-induced (UV) carcinogenesis, a major etiological factor in
human skin cancer. In the present study, we exposed mice with
keratinocyte-specific Smad4 deletion (K14.Smad4/) and wildtype (WT) mice
to chronic UV irradiation. Compared to WT littermates, K14.Smad4/ mice
exhibited increased susceptibility to UV-induced skin cancer.
Histological examination revealed that UV-induced Smad4/ tumors were all
SCCs. Moreover K14.Smad4/ skin shows increased DNA damage due to reduced
expression of DNA repair genes compared to WT skin. We have identified a
novel mechanism by which Smad4 suppresses skin cancer by promoting repair
of UV-induced DNA lesions.
