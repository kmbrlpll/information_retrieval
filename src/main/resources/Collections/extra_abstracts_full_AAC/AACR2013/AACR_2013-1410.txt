Title: Forced expression of EWS/ATF1 induces sarcomas in mice.


Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is an aggressive soft tissue malignant tumor
characterized by a unique t(12; 22) translocation, leading to the
expression of a chimeric EWS/ATF1 fusion gene. However, little is known
about the mechanisms underlying how EWS/ATF1 is involved in the
development of CCSs. In addition, the cells of origin for CCSs remain to
be determined. We generated EWS/ATF1-inducible mice, and examined the
effects of EWS/ATF1 expression in adult somatic cells. We show that the
forced expression of EWS/ATF1 results in the development of
EWS/ATF1-dependent sarcomas in mice. The histology of EWS/ATF1-induced
sarcomas resembles that of CCSs and EWS/ATF1-induced tumor cells express
CCS-markers, such as S100, Sox10, and Mitf. Lineage tracing experiments
using Wnt1-Cre and P0-Cre alleles indicated that neural crest-lineage
cells are permissive to EWS-ATF1-driven transformation.
