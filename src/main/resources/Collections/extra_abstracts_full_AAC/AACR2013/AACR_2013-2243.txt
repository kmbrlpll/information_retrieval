Title: Clonogenic 3D high throughput screening in mutant KRAS dependent
cancer cells - a chemogenomic approach.


Activating KRAS mutations are oncogenic and prevalent in multiple tumor
types, being found in as high as 90% of pancreatic carcinomas and 50% of
colorectal carcinomas. In spite of its attractiveness for therapeutic
intervention to date no KRAS-targeted drug therapies have been approved.
Most of the reported mutant KRAS directed cellular screening efforts
utilize 2-dimensional assays. Because mutant KRAS driven tumor cell lines
are much more strongly dependent on activated K-Ras signaling for
anchorage independent growth relative to growth when anchored to plastic,
we report herein a screening strategy that leverages a 3-dimensional
clonogenic growth assay in soft agar. We have performed a multi-cell line
parallel phenotypic high throughput screen with our proprietary compound
collection to identify pathways, targets and chemical matter with
selective anti-tumor activity in mutant KRAS dependent cell lines - a
Synthetic Lethal approach.Our strategy has led to the identification of
several chemical classes that inhibit the growth of multiple mutant KRAS
cell lines of pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma origin, while sparing
multiple wild-type KRAS cancer cell lines. Studies to elucidate their
molecular mechanisms of action are underway.
