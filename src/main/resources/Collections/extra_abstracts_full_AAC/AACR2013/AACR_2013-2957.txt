Title: Cellular level of HSP27 phosphorylation plays a key switch from
cell survival to death induced by TRAIL or gemcitabine.


TRAIL-induced activation of Akt catalytic activity and phosphorylation
were highly correlated with p38/HSP27 phosphorylation, whereas the
phosphorylation of p38/HSP27 increased further during incubation with
curcumin and TRAIL, which caused significant apoptotic cell death in
DU-145 cells. Next, we investigated whether the cellular level of HSP27
phosphorylation acts as a determinant of cell fate: from cell survival to
cell death by biphasic way using another anticancer agent, gemcitabine an
antitumor drug currently used for the treatment of advanced pancreatic
cancer. We have observed that gemcitabine induced p38/HSP27
phosphorylation and acquired resistance at lower concentration as TRAIL
did. After the acquisition of TRAIL or gemcitabine resistance, cancer
cells (DU-145 or Mia-PaCa) with acquired resistance to these drugs
expressed higher amount of vimentin as well as various MMPs. However, the
expression level of these proteins even in TRAIL or gemcitabine-resistant
cells was significantly decreased by the incorporation of constitutively
phospho-mimic HSP27 with concurrent cell death, providing a new potential
strategy to overcome the drug resistance and ultimate metastasis.
