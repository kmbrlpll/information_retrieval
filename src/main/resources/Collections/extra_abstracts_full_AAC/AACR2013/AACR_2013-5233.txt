Title: Modeling ionizing radiation exposure in vitro and in vivo using
the Virtual Tumour.


Ionizing radiation exposure induces DNA double strand breaks in mammalian
cells. In response, cells activate repair mechanisms which involve cell
cycle arrest at discrete transition points of the cell cycle. The results
in an accumulation of cells in S and G2 phase in an irradiated cell
population over a period of time following exposure.Using the Virtual
Tumour, a cell population simulator of cancer cells and tissue, we have
built a model of irradiation of tumour cell culture in vitro as well as
tumour tissue in vivo for various cancer cell types. We show how cell
cycle timings and radiosensitivity can accurately reproduce both in vivo
and in vitro response to irradiation-induced DNA damage. We also study
how the radiosensitization effect of gemcitabine is time-dependent. This
demonstrates how the Virtual Tumour can help maximise therapeutic
efficacy of combinations involving irradiation.
