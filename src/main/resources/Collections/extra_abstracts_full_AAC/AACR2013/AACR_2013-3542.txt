Title: Effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms on treatment outcomes
and toxicity in patients treated with sunitinib for biliary tract and
gastric cancers.


BACKGROUND: We analyzed the efficacy and toxicity profile of sunitinib
according to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VEGFA and KDR
among the patients with gastric or biliary tract cancer.METHODS: We
examined 8 known SNPs of VEGFA and 5 SNPs of KDR among patients with
gastric or biliary tract cancer who were treated with sunitinib in our
two previous phase II studies. We assessed progression free survival
(PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity and their relationships to
these SNPs.RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were evaluable. Among
candidate SNPs, rs2010963, rs833068, and rs1870377 were associated with
poor PFS (P = .009, .002, and .029, respectively), while rs1870377 and
rs7692791 were associated with poor OS (P = .001 and 0.03, respectively).
Multivariate analysis showed that only rs1870377 had significant effects
on both PFS and OS. Toxicity evaluation indicated that rs1531289 was
associated with grade 3-4 anemia. (P = .03).CONCLUSIONS: Certain SNPs of
KDR may affect treatment outcome and toxicity of patients treated with
sunitinib.
