Title: Epigallocatechin-gallate suppresses tumorigenesis by directly
targeting Pin1.


The most active anticancer component in green tea is
epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). The human peptidyl prolyl cis/trans
isomerase (Pin1) plays a critical role in oncogenic signaling. Herein, we
report the X-ray crystal structure of the Pin1/EGCG complex resolved at
1.9 resolution. Notably, the structure revealed the presence of EGCG in
both the WW and PP1ase domains of Pin1. The direct binding of EGCG with
Pin1 was confirmed and the interaction inhibited Pin1 PP1ase activity. In
addition, proliferation of cells expressing Pin1 was inhibited and tumor
growth in a xenograft mouse model was suppressed. The binding of EGCG
with Arg17 in the WW domain prevented the binding of c-Jun, a well-known
Pin1 substrate. EGCG treatment corresponded with a decreased abundance of
cyclin D1 and diminution of TPA-induced AP-1 or NFB promoter activity in
cells expressing Pin1. Overall, these results showed that EGCG directly
suppresses the tumor promoting effect of Pin1.
