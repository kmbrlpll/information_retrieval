Title: Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR is expressed in small cell lung cancer
and relevant to cellular proliferation, invasiveness and clinical relapse
- analyses based on tumor tissues and cell lines.


Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a subtype of lung cancer with poor
prognosis, showing early relapse after initial fair response to
chemotherapy. A long non-coding RNA, Hox transcript antisense intergenic
RNA (HOTAIR) has been reported to be involved in breast and colon cancer
metastasis. Here we revealed, using 35 surgical SCLC cases, that HOTAIR
was expressed highly in pure, rather than combined, SCLC (p=0.012) and
that a subset of SCLC with its higher expression tended to relapse
earlier (p=0.086). Also, knock down of HOTAIR by siRNA transfection in an
SCLC cell line, SBC-3, led to the reduced proliferation activity and
invasiveness, due to changes of expression of cell adhesion-related
genes. These findings suggest that the HOTAIR expression changes gene
expression in relation to cell adhesion and subsequently alters
proliferation activity and invasiveness of tumor cells, resulting in
early relapse of SCLC. Our results imply that HOTAIR could be a
prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target of SCLC.
