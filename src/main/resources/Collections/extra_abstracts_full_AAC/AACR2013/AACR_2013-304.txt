Title: Reactive oxygen species induce prostate cancer cells via
activation of the IL6/STAT3 pathway.


Background: Previously we have established a stepwise prostate
carcinogenesis model including human primary prostate epithelial EP156T
cells, non-malignant mesenchymal EPT1 cells and pre-malignant EPT2-D5
cells. Aims and methods: To further achieve malignant cells, EPT2-D5
cells were grown in protein-free medium and the tumorigenesis was tested
in vivo. Results: 1) Lots of spheres were generated in monolayer culture
of D5 cells in protein free medium. The sphere forming cells were named
D5HS. 2) Different from EPT2-D5 cells, D5HS formed large subcutaneous
tumors (EPT3) and metastasis (EPT3M) in SCID mice. 3) Gene expression
profiling showed inflammation signatures in D5HS. 4) Cellular Reactive
Oxygen Species Detection Assay (DCFDA) showed high reactive oxygen
species (ROS) in D5HS, and ELISA and Western blotting showed high
secreted IL6 and high STAT3 expression in D5HS. 5) Blocking of ROS or
STAT3 signaling reduced the sphere formation. 6) Immunohistochemistry
staining showed high pSTAT3 level in the EPT3 tumor. Conclusions:
Reactive oxygen species induce prostate cancer cells via activation of
the IL6/STAT3 pathway.
