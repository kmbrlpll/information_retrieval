Title: MicroRNA signatures predictive of response to chemotherapy in mCRC.


MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators involved in
numerous biological and pathological processes including colorectal
cancer (CRC). From a clinical perspective, several studies have
identified groups of miRNAs with potential utility for early diagnosis or
prognostic stratification of CRC patients. However, very few have
evaluated the potential ability of miRNA to predict response to selected
chemotherapy regimens. The aim of our study was to evaluate the ability
of miRNA expression patterns to predict chemotherapy response in a cohort
of 78 patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC). We examined tumor expression
levels of 667 miRNAs in the training cohort by TaqMan Low Density Arrays
(TLDA). In training cohort (N=39), we identified a miRNA molecular
signature with significant association in relevant clinical endpoints
(objective response, progression-free and overall survival). In
validation cohort (N=39), we validated significantly higher expression
levels of miR-107, and miR99a* according to objective response to
fluoropyrimidine-based regimens. These results support a substantial role
for miRNAs in determining drug response, and highlight their potential
value as biomarkers for personalized treatment strategies and as a novel
class of therapeutic targets.
