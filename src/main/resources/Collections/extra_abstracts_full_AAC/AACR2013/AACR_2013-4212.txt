Title: Deep sequencing analysis of the ALK kinase domain identifies
resistant mutations in relapse patients following crizotinib treatment.


ALK resistance mutations conferring resistance to Xalkori vary widely
within the tyrosine kinase domain. So far, nine different acquired
resistant mutations have been identified in the clinic, including
1151Tins, L1152R, C1156Y, F1174C, L1196M, G1202R, D1203N, S1206Y, and,
G1296A. We developed a deep sequencing method using semiconductor
sequencing technology to quickly detect resistance mutations within the
ALK kinase domain in tumor biopsies. By bar-coding, we were able to
sequence multiple samples in a single run. We have also developed an
algorithm to determine assay noisy level and call mutations
automatically. The assay sensitivity to call close to 1% mutated allele
demonstrated by a titration experiment with a cell line harboring a know
mutation. Genomic DNA analysis from relapsed patients revealed several
known mutations. Our assay demonstrates robust and sensitive detection of
ALK kinase mutations in NSCLC tumor samples and aids in the elucidation
of resistance mechanisms pertinent to the clinical setting.
