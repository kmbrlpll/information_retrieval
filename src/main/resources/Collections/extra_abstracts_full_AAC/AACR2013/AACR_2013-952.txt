Title: Stemofoline is a potent natural product modulator of the multidrug
resistance-linked P-glycoprotein (ABCB1).


Background: Stemofoline is a plant alkaloid isolated form Stemona, which
is native to southeastern Asia. P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a member of the
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily is implicated in
multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. Aim: To investigate the
effect of stemofoline on Pgp function.Methods and Results: Stemofoline
stimulated Pgp-mediated ATP hydrolysis (conc. required for 50%
stimulation= 10-12, M), suggesting that this alkaloid seems to interact
with drug-binding site of Pgp. Consistent with this view, stemofoline
inhibited the photo-crosslinking of Pgp with [125I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin
(IAAP), which is a transport substrate. Interestingly, stemofoline
instead of inhibiting verapamil-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, it further
enhanced the ATPase activity suggesting that stemofoline and verapamil
bind simultaneously to Pgp in the drug-binding pocket. In addition, the
efflux of the fluorescent substrate calcein-AM from P-gp expressing
cervical cancer cells (KB-V1) was blocked by stemofoline in a
concentration-dependent manner.Conclusion: These studies indicate that
stemofoline could be developed as a potent modulator to overcome MDR in
cancer cells.
