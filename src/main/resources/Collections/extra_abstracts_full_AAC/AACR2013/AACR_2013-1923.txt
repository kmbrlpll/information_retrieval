Title: Constitutional mismatch repair-deficiency syndrome is a rare cause
of cancer even in a highly consanguineous population.


Background:Biallelic germline mutations in the mismatch repair genes
MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 cause a recessive childhood cancer syndrome
characterized by early onset malignancies and signs reminiscent of
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). This syndrome is known as constitutional
mismatch repair-deficiency (CMMR-D) syndrome. Because consanguinity
unmasks autosomal recessive disorders, we hypothesized that the frequency
of CMMR-D is inflated in the highly consanguineous population of Saudi
Arabia.Methods:372 patient samples from Saudi Arabia that cover the tumor
spectrum of CMMR-D syndrome were analyzed for biallelic germline
mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 with the use of direct genomic
sequencing.Results:None of the 372 patients involved in the study was
found to have biallelic pathological mutations of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or
PMS2.Conclusion:CMMR-D is exceptionally rare among pediatric cancer
patients and adult early onset cancer patients, even in the highly
consanguineous Saudi population. Our findings suggest that larger cohorts
will be needed, particularly in outbred populations, to determine the
frequency of CMMR-D and that routine screening for this syndrome among
cancer patients is not warranted.
