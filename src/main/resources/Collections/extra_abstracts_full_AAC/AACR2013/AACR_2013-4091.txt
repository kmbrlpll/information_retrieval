Title: RapidCap: A new generation of mouse models for prostate cancer.


Genetically Engineered Mouse Models are the gold standard for functional
cancer research. However, the associated time and cost requirements
severely limit their application. As a consequence, projects carry
typically a high risk, are lengthy, and scientists become locked in with
a few chosen candidate alterations. To realize the full potential of
mouse modeling technology we have developed RapidCaP, a system that
relies on surgical gene transfer. Through prostate specic delivery of
transgenic virus we can 1) reduce model generation times from several
years to a few weeks, 2) test various genetic alterations such as loss or
gain of function, alone or in combination, and 3) use non-invasive
imaging to monitor disease progression. Using RapidCaP, we show that
focal loss of Pten and Trp53 genes triggers prostate lesions within 2
months. Furthermore, we nd that this disease responds to castration by
strong regression within several weeks, but it later relapses to produce
lethal hormone refractory disease. Taken together, our approach
establishes a novel platform for basic prostate cancer research and it
realizes the goal of carrying out pre-clinical studies in genetically
engineered mice.
