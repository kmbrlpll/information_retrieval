Title: Osteopontin regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition via
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.


Our previous studies demonstrated that osteopontin (OPN) plays a crucial
role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis. However, its function
in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains obscure. In this
study, we reported the critical role of OPN in EMT mediated HCC
metastasis. Increased expression of OPN in human HCC predicts poor
survival and disease recurrence after surgery. HCC tumors overexpressing
OPN were featured by active EMT and motility/invasion of tumor cells both
in vitro and in vivo, whereas silencing OPN expression attenuatedEMT. OPN
overexpression enhanced twist through activation of Akt, a critical EMT
regulation of transcription factor. Suppression of the PI3K-AKT-Twist
pathway interfered with OPN-mediated EMT and invasion. Consistently, we
have observed a significant correlation between OPN expression and twist
levels in a cohort of HCC patients, and found that combination of these
two parameters is a more powerful predictor of poor
prognosis.Conclusions: OPN plays a pivotal role in EMT mediated HCC
metastasis and may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic
target.
