Title: A comparison between the OV100 and Maestro fluorescence imaging
systems for noninvasive detection of metastasis.


The OV100 (Olympus Corp.), and Maestro (Perkin-Elmer Inc.), were compared
for imaging metastasis in orthotopic lung, liver, pancreas and colon nude
mouse tumor models expressing RFP. Non-invasive images of tumor-bearing
mice indicated that the Maestro systems outperformed the OV100 for macro
imaging. Tumors could be detected earlier with the Maestro system than
with the OV100. By separating skin and food autofluorescence, the Maestro
provides a high-contrast image. The Maestro can produce a composite image
of five unmixed components and detects tumors deeper than the OV100. The
Maestro can also detect more color signals simultaneously. However, the
OV100 has higher resolution and even a single cell can be imaged, for
example via a skin-flap. The results of this study suggest that the two
instruments are complimentary.
