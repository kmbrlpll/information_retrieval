Title: Inactivation of a transcriptional variant of MAP1LC3A gene in
human cancers.


Autophagy functions to clear damaged or unfolded cellular components in
the lysosomes as a survival pathway used by established cancers to
sustain metabolism and tolerate stress. Autophagy, however, also suppress
cancer initiation in liver and the accumulation of p62/SQSTM1 protein, a
substrate for autophagic degradation, contributes to its tumorigenesis,
suggesting that autophagy-related gene(s) may be actually inactivated in
a part of human cancers at least. Recently, we have identified that a
transcriptional variant of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain
3A (LC3Av1), a member of human LC3 gene family, was frequently
inactivated by aberrant DNA methylation in human cancers. Induction of
wild-type LC3Av1 led to the decrease of p62 protein level, resulting in
the inhibition of tumor growth, but not its mutant with the C-terminal
glycine (lipidation site) changed to alanine. Thus, these results suggest
that the impairment of autophagy through LC3Av1-silencing due to DNA
methylation may be associated with tumorigenesis in various types of
human cancer.
