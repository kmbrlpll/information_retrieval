Title: PHLPP suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer cell
invasion by negatively regulating RAF1 activity.


PHLPP belongs to a family of protein phosphatases that have previously
been shown to inhibit Akt-mediated cell proliferation and survival
signaling in cancers. Here, we demonstrate that PHLPP exerts its tumor
suppressor function by negatively regulating the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway to
inhibit cell migration and invasion. Specifically, we identify the
oncogenic protein kinase RAF1 as an interacting protein and a novel
substrate of PHLPP. PHLPP dephosphorylates the S338 site of RAF1 and
inactivates the kinase both in vitro and in cells. Loss of PHLPP
expression largely increases the amplitude and duration of RAF/MEK/ERK
signaling in cells, whereas overexpression of PHLPP inhibits the pathway.
Functionally, knockdown of PHLPP induces epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT)-like phenotype, which coincides with a significant
increase in migration and invasion in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, we
show that upregulation of transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2 is
responsible for increased invasiveness observed in PHLPP knockdown cells.
Taken together, we have identified a novel role of PHLPP in suppressing
EMT and cell motility in colon cancer cells by directly antagonizing RAF1
function.
