Title: Discovery and optimization of potent SDF1 antagonist peptides.


The SDF1 / CXCR4 axis contributes to cancer metastasis, proliferation,
angiogenesis and resistance to standard of care drugs. Here we describe
novel phage display derived peptide SDF1 antagonists. Phage displayed
peptides were optimized through a multistep process that resulted in a
400-fold improvement in activity, from 6.4 uM IC50 inhibition of SDF1
-driven Calcium flux to 16 nM IC50. First, peptides were affinity matured
via panning of focused phage libraries. Peptides exhibiting enhanced
potency were bioconjugated to the CovX antibody scaffold IgG (CVX-2000),
generating bivalent CovX-Bodies with 5-fold improved potency in SDF1
driven Calcium flux assays. N and C-terminal extension of the peptide and
introduction of unnatural amino acids produced an additional 11-fold
improvement in activity to 16 nM. Constructs with optimal pharmacokinetic
stability were identified, and demonstrated single agent tumor inhibition
in a Ramos B cell lymphoma xenograft model.
